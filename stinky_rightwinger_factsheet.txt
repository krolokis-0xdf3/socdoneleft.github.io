# causes: prices
most cost increases are due to price increases rather than utilization increases: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1769890> Since 2000, (1) price (especially of hospital charges [+4.2%/y], professional services [+3.6%/y], drugs and devices [+4.0%/y], and administrative costs [+5.6%/y]), not demand for services or aging of the population, produced 91% of cost increases; (2) personal out-of-pocket spending on insurance premiums and co-payments have declined from 23% to 11%; and (3) chronic illnesses account for 84% of costs overall among the entire population, not only of the elderly.
<https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.89> As shown in Exhibits 4 and 5 , in 2000 the United States had fewer physicians per 1,000 population, physician visits per capita, acute care beds per capita, hospital admissions per 1,000 population, and acute care days per capita than the median OECD country. These simple comparisons suggest that Americans are receiving fewer real resources than are people in the median OECD country. [....] The researchers estimated that Americans paid 40 percent more per capita than Germans did but received 15 percent fewer real health care resources. A similar comparison revealed that the U.S. system used about 30 percent more inputs per capita than was used in the British system and spent about 75 percent more per capita on higher prices.
since 1960, price increases have represented >50% of each year's increase in national health expenditure: <https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/HistoricalNHEPaper.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/571189074241781763/unknown.png

# causes: wastage

# causes: administration
administrative spending as a portion of overall healthcare spending is 8% in the US (compared to a mean of 3% for other high-income countries): <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2674671> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/472872275402817556/unknown.png
overhead takes 31% of US healthcare but just 17% of Canadian healthcare spending: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa022033> In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least $294.3 billion in the United States, or $1,059 per capita, as compared with $307 per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada's national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada's private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers' administrative costs were far lower in Canada.
in 2014, administrative expenses (including fraud and abuse control expenses) were $8.8 billion of $613.3 billion total expenditures (1.43%): <https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/reportstrustfunds/downloads/tr2015.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640291423165349903/unknown.png
in 2017, administrative costs and profits accounted for $144.1 billion of $1183.9 billion (12.2%) for private insurance, $36.1 of $705.9 (5.11%) for Medicare, and $33.6 of $581.9 (5.77%) for Medicaid: <https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.html> (NHE tables, Table 4)
administrative costs  were 13% overall (11% for large group plans, 16% for small group plans, and 20% for individual plans) and profits were 2% overall (2% for large group plans, 3% for small group plans, and -1% for nongroup plans) for private insurance from 2010-2012: <https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/51130-Health_Insurance_Premiums.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640271316188004373/unknown.png

# fraud: private vs public
fraud elimination has been effective: <http://archive.is/Dn9UB> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/543707411131924482/20140531_USC154.png Federal prosecutors had over 2,000 health-fraud probes open at the end of 2013. A Medicare “strike force”, which was formed in 2007, boasts of seven nationwide “takedowns”. In the latest, on May 13th, 90 people, including 16 doctors, were rounded up in six cities—more than half of them in Miami, the capital city of medical fraud. One doctor is alleged to have fraudulently charged for $24m of kit, including 1,000 power wheelchairs.
the reason Medicare has high fraud rates is because they pay out without checking whether a bill is legitimate(!): <http://medicareintegrity.org/error-rate-drops-but-medicare-still-lost-31-6-billion-to-preventable-billing-errors-in-fy2018/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640906317849952277/davis_mirror_2014_es1_for_web.png Like private payers, Medicare can leverage pre-payment audits to prevent improper payments. In FY2012, CMS successfully tested prepayment audits during the Medicare Prepayment Review Demonstration project. Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) were authorized to review certain error prone Medicare claims for billing accuracy before they were paid. As a result of this short pilot program RACs prevented more than $192 million in improper payments from leaving the Medicare Trust Funds in error. The pilot program was so successful that the GAO recommended that “CMS should actively seek legislative authority to have RAs conduct prepayment claim reviews.”
the fraud rate of medicare fee-for-service is about 2x that of healthcare at large: <http://web.archive.org/web/20070813221400/http://www.nhcaa.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?webcode=anti_fraud_resource_centr&wpscode=TheProblemOfHCFraud> Each year, for example, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducts a formal audit of the Medicare program’s fee-for-service claim payment system. On February 21, 2002, the HHS-OIG reported its finding that of the $191.8 billion such claims paid in 2001, 6.3 percent – amounting to $12.1 billion – should not have been paid due to erroneous billing or payment, inadequate provider documentation of services to back up the claims and/or outright fraud. In May, 2004, the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association (NHCAA) reported in its Anti-Fraud Management Survey that 52 of its member insurers collectively recovered or prevented payment of $503 million in 2003 as a direct result of their anti-fraud activities – a great deal of money, but barely a measurable fraction of the total estimated loss. The bottom line: The NHCAA estimates that of the nation’s annual health care outlay, at least 3 percent – or $51 billion in calendar-year 2003- is lost to outright fraud. Other estimates by government and law enforcement agencies place the loss as high as 10 percent of our annual expenditure – or $170 billion – each year.
medicare-medicaid improperly pays about $65 billion per year (8.7% of $743 billion total): <https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/04/darrell-issa/rep-darrell-issa-claims-government-could-save-125-/> <https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/11/16/improper-payment-progress> <https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/Background_on_Accountable_Government_Initiative.pdf> On June 8, 2010, the President announced that the Administration would cut the improper payment rate in the Medicare Fee for Service program in half by FY 2012. Considering that Medicare and Medicaid combined had about $65 billion in improper payments in FY 2009 including about $35 billion in Medicare Fee For Service alone, halving the improper payment rate would help avoid more than $20 billion in payment errors by FY 2012. [....] About a third of Medicare's improper payments are the result of a claim not having enough, or proper, documentation. Upon further investigation, many of those claims are ultimately deemed proper. One example is a payment based on a claim by a doctor who submits forms that are illegible. Also, not all improper claims can be completely recouped. For example, say a surgeon was paid $10,000 for an inpatient procedure when Medicare only reimburses for an outpatient procedure that costs $5,000. The government wouldn't recoup the full $10,000, just the $5,000.
the overall cost of fraud is estimated at $85 billion to $272 billion per year: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1148376> Fraud and Abuse: the waste that comes as fraudsters issue fake bills and run scams,28 and also from the blunt procedures of inspection and regulation that everyone faces because of the misbehaviors of a very few. We estimate that this category represented between $82 billion and $272 billion in wasteful spending in 2011.20,29

even in poor countries, the public sector provides higher quality care: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378609/> Public sector provision was associated with higher rates of treatment success for tuberculosis and HIV [61]–[64] as well as vaccination [65],[66]. For example, in Pakistan, a matched cohort study in Karachi found that public sector tuberculosis care resulted in an 85% higher treatment success rate than private sector care [63]. In Thailand, patients seeking care in private institutions had significantly lower treatment success rates for tuberculosis, which was attributed to a three to five times greater likelihood of being prescribed non-WHO-recommended regimens than in the public sector [61]. In South Korea, tuberculosis treatment success rates were 51.8% in private clinics as opposed to 79.7% in public clinics, with only 26.2% of patients in private clinics receiving the recommended therapy, and over 40% receiving an inappropriately short duration of therapy [62]. Similarly higher rates of treatment failure were observed for private than public system patients on antiretroviral therapy for HIV in Botswana [64]. In India, an analysis of over 120,000 households, adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors, found that children receiving private health services were less likely to receive measles vaccinations [65]. Similar findings were reported from Cambodia [66].

42.4% of those with cancer lose their entire life savings in just 2 years: <https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(18)30509-6/fulltext> Across 9.5 million estimated new diagnoses of cancer from 2000–2012, individuals averaged 68.6±9.4 years with slight majorities being married (54.7%), not retired (51.1%), and Medicare beneficiaries (56.6%). At year+2, 42.4% depleted their entire life's assets, with higher adjusted odds associated with worsening cancer, requirement of continued treatment, demographic and socioeconomic factors (ie, female, Medicaid, uninsured, retired, increasing age, income, and household size), and clinical characteristics (ie, current smoker, worse self-reported health, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease) (P<.05); average losses were $92,098. At year+4, financial insolvency extended to 38.2%, with several consistent socioeconomic, cancer-related, and clinical characteristics remaining significant predictors of complete asset depletion.

# cost increases
declining state support for colleges explains the vast majority of rising college costs: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/549644363253153812/unknown.png
administrative bloat cannot explain rising tuition prices: there are no more employees per student in 2012 than in 1990, and the portion of employees who are faculty has risen from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640985138498371730/Higher-Ed20Ladder20Fig.png
increased student aid doesn't correlate with increased tuition: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> The claim that increased student aid causes tuition to rise was originated by William Bennett, the secretary of education under Ronald Reagan, in a 1987 New York Times opinion piece.19 Numerous academic studies since have tested the Bennett hypothesis, and though a few have found some link between rising aid and tuition in at most one sector of higher education,20 the vast majority have “…found not a shred of evidence of an empirical relationship,” as David Warren wrote in the Washington Post.21 As Warren notes, three major federal reports in the last fifteen years have each surveyed the existing academic literature, and each concluded that no such relationship exists. The most recent, conducted by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011, took advantage of a unique “natural experiment” to test the Bennett hypothesis: the substantial increases in Stafford Loan limits between 2007 and 2009.22 In 2007, the yearly loan limits, adjusted for inflation, ranged from $2,925 for freshmen to $6,125 for upper classmen. By 2009, they had risen to $5,750 and $7,825, respectively. All told, the yearly borrowing limit for all undergraduates increased by an average of $2,340. However, average tuition at public 4-year universities rose by just $540 over the same two years, in line with recent historical averages, leading the GAO to reject the possibility of a relationship between the two. Additionally, these increases in borrowing limits were the first since 1993, meaning that the inflation-adjusted value of the limit had declined for more than a decade during which tuitions rose steadily. All told, both the empirical evidence and academic consensus deem the Bennett hypothesis false.
construction cannot explain the rise in tuition: <https://www.demos.org/publication/pulling-higher-ed-ladder-myth-and-reality-crisis-college-affordability> To get an idea of the maximum impact that the additional borrowing could have on college costs, enrollment at the largest public institutions—approximating the 224 universities and university systems included in the Moody’s data—totaled 10.2 million in fall 2012.25 If all debt service costs were paid for by students, this would yield a figure of $367 per student in increased debt service costs over the past decade. [....] Though we can’t estimate an exact impact on tuition, if we fairly estimate that half of these costs are paid for by students, we find that increased borrowing to fund college construction could account for about 5 percent of the tuition increases over the past decade. Clearly, increased college construction costs are not a major cause of rising tuition.

if someone claims to have read "Das Kapital", here's a simple test: ask them to define "M-C-M". the phrase occurs first in Volume 1, Chapter 3: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch03.htm> The exchange of commodities is therefore accompanied by the following changes in their form. Commodity-Money-Commodity, C-M-C. The result of the whole process is, so far as concerns the objects themselves, C-C, the exchange of one commodity for another, the circulation of materialised social labour. When this result is attained, the process is at an end.

if someone claims to know Keynsian economics, ask them to define IS-LM.

# efficiency
markets are efficient if and only if P = NP: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2284> I prove that if markets are weak-form efficient, meaning current prices fully reflect all information available in past prices, then P = NP, meaning every computational problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. I also prove the converse by showing how we can “program” the market to solve NP-complete problems. Since P probably does not equal NP, markets are probably not efficient. Specifically, markets become increasingly inefficient as the time series lengthens or becomes more frequent.

[...] Given that any set of relative prices can be expressed as p_i/p_j = (w_i\*v_i)/(w_j\*v_j)\*chi_ij where chi_ij = (1+sigma_pw_i)/(1+sigma_pw_j), **we would expect that structural factors summarized in relative integrated labor times v_i/v_j do not change very much in the short run**. On the other hand, over the short but turbulent period **from the peak to the trough of the business cycle**, which is usually less than a year, **there are large movements in industry outputs, wages, and profits**. Hence, peak-to-trough movements provide excellent conditions for tests of the sensitivity of relative prices to wages and profits, which was precisely Ricardo's concern (Petrovic 1987, 197, 200). Schwartz examined relative price movements over four business cycles from 1919 to 1938, including the Great Depression. **He found that sectoral outputs vary from 30% to 60%, and housing contracts and wages by 40%. Yet the average variation in relative sectoral prices is merely 7.33%!** [...] Puty (2007) extends Schwartz's test to thirty-one US business cycles over 1856-1969, with sectoral prices taken relative to wholesale price index. [...] As shown in table 9.12, Puty's results strongly support Schwartz's original findings: **quantities vary by 22.2% over thirty-one NBER-dated cycles while they vary while they vary by 30.6% over individual industry cycles;** on the other hand, despite the turbulence associated in going from peaks-to-troughs of business cyles including the Great Depression, **relative market prices vary on average by only 8.45% over NBER dates and 9.22% over local ones.**

[....] The findings highlight the importance of recognizing endogeneity and the nontrivial performance challenges facing newly private enterprises in a framework with agency and expropriation costs. The tradeoff is most pronounced for enterprises that enjoyed subsidies prior to privatization. They experience negative effects for up to 10 years. In the long run, the effect becomes insignificant.
public infrastructure investment produces longterm economic growth: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036849700000023> Annual data over 1970-90 for 48 developing countries form the basis of the empirical analysis. Our findings suggest that infrastructural public investment facilitates private investment, especially in the long-run. It also promotes economic growth and efficiency whereas non-infrastructural investment does the reverse. Also, long-term effects of public investment tend to be much more positive than short-term ones on growth.

The overall impact of vertical integration was to increase the prices of products bottled by vertically-integrated bottlers by 1.6 percent. Dynamic effects estimates show that the price increases in products bottled by a vertically-integrated bottler only started after the vertical transactions took place, and the price increases persisted in time. These results suggest that vertical integration with multiproduct firms has the potential of harming consumers because of how the vertically-integrated multiproduct firms use rival-brand prices to divert demand to their (more profitable to sell) own brands.

# theory: critiques
the two main critiques of central planning have been 'theoretical incomputability' (computing optimal resource allocation is mathematically impossible) and 'practical incomputability' (insufficient information or computation is available for this problem): <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> 

# theory: theoretical computability (economic calculation problem)
infite possible commodities does not imply uncomputability, as very few possible commodities have nonzero price, inputs, or outputs: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565303895241392128/unknown.png

# theory: practical computability (economic calculation problem)
in practice, planning for economies of modern scale is easily computed even on home computers: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565302380841926656/unknown.png
capitalism can be conceptualized as an iterative input-output model: <http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~greg/publications/ccm.IJUC07.pdf> Firms add up wage costs and costs of other commodity inputs, add a markup, and set their prices accordingly. This distributed algorithm, which is nowadays carried out by a combination of people and company computers, is structurally similar to the solution of linear equations by an iterative method. This models one phase of the iterative solution of Sraffa’s equations. Empirical evidence indicates that the price vector upon which the process converges lies somewhere near the vector of labour values see [29, 24].

# theory: natural resources
neither capitalism nor socialism properly 'prices in' finite resources: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> Socialist planners “presumably would have to develop some kind of proxy for the value of nonreproducible resources in units of labour hours. It is difficult to imagine how this could be done in a way that would not be completely arbitrary.” We do not wish to deny there is a problem here. We do, however, find it rather remarkable that Mises (and his expositor, Lavoie) should talk as if the problem solves itself under capitalism. Neither offers any criticism of the classic Ricardian theory, according to which the market price system also fails to take into account non-reproducible resources. For Ricardo, natural resource constraints manifest themselves in the price system via rising marginal cost of production, i.e. just the effect which Mises takes to be inadequate. [....] In fact, matters are not infrequently worse under capitalism. The fact that a certain resource is ultimately exhaustible does not necessarily mean that it is subject to diminishing returns in the short run. In the westward expansion of American agriculture, for instance, the (geographically) marginal land was actually the most productive. In such cases the market provides no incentive whatever for resource conservation; the results were painfully evident in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. We are not claiming that labour-time calculation would necessarily do better in cases where the market fails to conserve resources. We do contend, however, that socialist planners should be able to take more far-sighted decisions on resource conservation than profit-maximizing firms.

# theory: nonhomogenous labor
the value of skilled labor may be calculated as the "labor price" required to produce said skilled labor: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pd> True, labour is not homogeneous, but there is no warrant for the claim that the reduction factor for complex labour has to be arbitrary under socialism. Skilled labour may be treated in the same way that Marx treats the means of production in Capital, namely as a produced input which ‘transfers’ embodied labour to its product over time. Given the labour time required to produce skills and a depreciation horizon for those skills, one may calculate an implied ‘rate of transfer’ of the labour time embodied in the skills. If we call this rate, for skill i, ri , then labour of this type should be counted as a multiple (1 + ri) of simple labour, for the purpose of ‘costing’ its products. Of course the labour input required for the production of skills is likely to be a mixture of skilled and simple, which complicates the calculation of the skill multipliers. An iterative procedure is needed: first calculate the transfer rates as if all inputs were simple labour, then use those first-round transfer rates to re-evaluate the skilled labour inputs, on this basis recompute the transfer rates, and so on, until convergence is reached.

# theory: labor vouchers
labor vouchers: <http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/calculation_debate.pdf> The labour certificates Marx talks of here are quite different from money. They do not circulate, rather they are cancelled against the acquisition of consumer goods of equivalent labour content. And they may be used for consumer goods alone; they cannot purchase means of production or labour power, and hence cannot function as capital.

# intent: capitalists not evil
marx claims capitalists can be good and, by competition, be forced into exploitation (eg, child labor) unless society forces them not to: <https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch10.htm> Après moi le déluge! [After me, the flood] is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Hence Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society. But looking at things as a whole, all this does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist. [....] We, therefore, find, e.g., that in the beginning of 1863, 26 firms owning extensive potteries in Staffordshire, amongst others, Josiah Wedgwood, & Sons, petition in a memorial for “some legislative enactment.” Competition with other capitalists permits them no voluntary limitation of working-time for children, &c. “Much as we deplore the evils before mentioned, it would not be possible to prevent them by any scheme of agreement between the manufacturers. ... Taking all these points into consideration, we have come to the conviction that some legislative enactment is wanted.”

But without the leave, and behind the back, of our weaver, the old-fashioned mode of weaving undergoes a change. The labour-time that yesterday was without doubt socially necessary to the production of a yard of linen, ceases to be so to-day, a fact which the owner of the money is only too eager to prove from the prices quoted by our friend’s competitors. Unluckily for him, weavers are not few and far between. Lastly, suppose that every piece of linen in the market contains no more labour-time than is socially necessary. In spite of this, all these pieces taken as a whole, may have had superfluous labour-time spent upon them. If the market cannot stomach the whole quantity at the normal price of 2 shillings a yard, this proves that too great a portion of the total labour of the community has been expended in the form of weaving. The effect is the same as if each individual weaver had expended more labour-time upon his particular product than is socially necessary. Here we may say, with the German proverb: caught together, hung together. All the linen in the market counts but as one article of commerce, of which each piece is only an aliquot part. And as a matter of fact, the value also of each single yard is but the materialised form of the same definite and socially fixed quantity of homogeneous human labour. 17

They followed a pattern similar to their nineteenth century counterparts, usually 14 beginning with a speculative bubble, which was followed by a severe stock market crash and a recession. While the response by government has not always been the same, the boom and bust cycle has continued. Some common causes for this cycle include inadequate regulation of the financial sector. Many of these aspects have carried over into the current financial crisis.

economic stimulus prevented the 2006-2008 Recession from reducing growth in china -- despite facing the same export crises as Russia and South Africa: <https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/wp/2014/2014-007.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/539255259575615508/unknown.png Also, total industrial production in China nearly doubled between 2007 and 2013 despite the crisis and an extremely weak international demand for Chinese goods, whereas the United States has experienced zero growth in industrial production and that in the European Union and Japan has declined by 9.3% and 17.1%, respectively. No wonder Chinaís economic growth contributed 50% of global GDP growth during the crisis period (IMF, 2010), even though its income level accounted for less than 10% of world GDP and its total exports have remained 45% below trend since the crisis.
interest rates can explain just 20% of the 2006 housing crisis: <http://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/679.pdf> The modest predicted impact of interest rates on prices is in line with empirical estimates, and it suggests that lower real rates can explain only one-fifth of the rise in prices from 1996 to 2006. We also find no convincing evidence that changes in approval rates or loan-to-value levels can explain the bulk of the changes in house prices, but definitive judgments on those mechanisms cannot be made without better corrections for the endogeneity of borrowers’ decisions to apply for mortgages.

78% of growth over the last 150 years can be explained by improvements in education and research intensity: <https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.104.5.44> As the figure shows, the 2 percent annual growth in labor productivity largely came from rising human capital (0.4 percentage points per year, about 20 percent of the total) and rising research intensity in the advanced countries of the world (1.2 percentage points, or 58 percent of the total).

# public sector efficient
public sector pharmaceutical research is 2x more likely to get primary review: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1008268> The FDA assigns the application one of two types of review on the basis of its therapeutic potential: priority review if the drug shows substantial improvement, as compared with currently marketed products for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease, or standard review if the drug appears to have therapeutic qualities similar to those of one or more drugs that are already on the market. [....] During this period, the FDA approved 1541 new-drug applications but granted priority review to just 348 applications (22.6%) (Table 2). **Of the 1541 total approvals, 143 (9.3%) resulted from PSRIs. However, of the 348 priority reviews, 66 (19.0%) resulted from PSRIs, or twice the overall rate for priority reviews. Viewed from another perspective, 46.2% of new-drug applications from PSRIs received priority reviews, as compared with 20.0% of applications that were based purely on private-sector research, an increase by a factor of 2.3.
^ drugs approved close to (within 2 months of) their Congress-mandated deadline had greater adverse effects (black-box warnings and safety-based withdrawls), but priority review products were not more likely to have adverse effects: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00544.x> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00544.x> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634831533966098442/unknown.png To assess claims that lower-quality policy outcomes may arise from inherent drug uncertainty, we include two measures to capture agency uncertainty. One is an indicator of whether the FDA designated the drug for priority review, a designation reservedfor drugs that represent significant innovation over existing therapies. Such innovation holds potential for greater drug safety and efficacy but greater uncertainty as new formulations are introduced into the market for the first time. [....] There appears to be no stratification in the deadline effect across priority and nonpriority reviews, save for dosage-form discontinuations, where there is a deadline effect among standard drugs but not among priority drugs (see the online appendix, Tables A13a, b).
^ drugs approved close to (within 2 months of) their Congress-mandated deadline had greater adverse effects (disability, hospitalization, or death), and priority review products were more likely to have adverse effects: <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/589934> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1086/589934> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634830568017625099/unknown.png Initiation of the PDUFA requirements concentrated the number of approval decisions made in the weeks immediately preceding the deadlines. As compared with drugs approved at other times, drugs approved in the 2 months before their PDUFA deadlines were more likely to be withdrawn for safety reasons (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 27.8), more likely to carry a subsequent black-box warning (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 20.5), and more likely to have one or more dosage forms voluntarily discontinued by the manufacturer (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 7.5).
^ the FDA's priority review system is effective at categorizing drugs with high clinical added value: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00228-016-2104-3> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s00228-016-2104-3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/634838277718802454/unknown.png The Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) is a French government agency that provides recommendations on reimbursement decisions of medicinal products made by the public authorities. Their decisions are based on a clinical added value (CAV) using a five-level scoring system that takes into account the comparative efficacy and safety data of a new drug with regards to available treatments[.] [....] The positive predictive value corresponded to the number of NME seen in shorter review time and highly clinical added value (i.e., true positive) among the total of shorter review time NME. The negative predictive value corresponded to the number of NME not seen in shorter review time and slightly clinical added value (i.e., true negative) among the total of non-shorter review time NME. [....] Secondly, among the 43 NME judged as of highly clinical added value by HAS, shorter review time was considered for 37 of them by the FDA compared to 13 of them by the EMA.

# free markets not efficient
free-er markets for medicine aren't more innovative: the United States doesn't create more new pharmaceutical drugs (NMEs) than would be expected by its spending on pharmaceuticals: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866602/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/458596499392167936/unknown.png

# inequality reduces innovation
innovation is highly increased by parental income and exposure to innovation locations and innovators: <https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/qje/qjy028/5218522?redirectedFrom=fulltext> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/536431976312209408/unknown.png We then directly establish the importance of environment by showing that exposure to innovation during childhood has significant causal effects on children’s propensities to invent. Children whose families move to a high-innovation area when they are young are more likely to become inventors. These exposure effects are technology-class and gender specific. Children who grow up in a neighborhood or family with a high innovation rate in a specific technology class are more likely to patent in exactly the same class.

# patents correlate with innovation
in 1982, countywide patents were highly correlated with innovations (as measured by the Futures Group for the Small Business Administration): <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733301001846> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/s0048-7333(01)00184-6> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640654909867556882/unknown.png
between 0 and 60% of inventions would not have been developed without a patent system and 60-80% of patent-able inventions are patented, according to a survey of 100 medium-size firms in 1981-82: <https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.32.2.173> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1287/mnsc.32.2.173> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640655825148444696/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640656962589163549/unknown.png

# privatization and innovation
in China, privatization of an SOE is associated with a loss of innovation except in areas with strong property rights (college density is 100x more powerful): <https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/30/7/2446/3098495> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/rfs/hhx023> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640661988053352449/unknown.png SOEs in China, in fact, have a two-tiered defense against expropriation: through administrative measures by the government (the firms’ owners), and through the courts, which are often biased in their favor (Snyder 2012). This explanation suggests that China’s innovation should be led by the SOEs, and because they rely on the state, institutions such as IPR protection do not matter much. We call this the “alternative mechanisms view.” [....] To address these empirical challenges, we exploit China’s privatizations of SOEs as an identification method. The idea is that the privatization events result in a sharp change in the firms’ ownership structures and state affiliations, while keeping other firm attributes fixed. [....] Invention patents have the highest innovative content, as they cover novel technologies. Utility patents cover new applications of existing technologies.

# where innovation occurs
in manufacturing, higher innovation (as measured via publication in relevant manufacturing journals) is associated with higher large firm (500+) employment, higher R&D, lower concentration, lower unionization, higher skilled labor, and larger industries: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1811167> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/631895637167702026/unknown.png `Thus, based on the U.S. Small Business Administration's classification of the significance level of innovations, there does not appear to be a great difference in the "quality" and significance of the innovations between large and small firms. However, the extent of innovative activity does not necessarily correspond to the market values of the innovations. It is conceivable that larger firms may tend to focus on innovations with a higher market value.` [....] `A random sample of 600 firms (with 375 responses) was used to allocate the entire set of innovations into 55 percent from small firms and 45 percent from large firms, resulting in an innovation- per-employee ratio 2.38 times greater in small firms than in large firms.`

# capitalism discourages r&d
most capitalist industries have very low rates of R&D: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2089358> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/503051683966877708/unknown.png
pharmaceutical companies in the USA spend 2x more on advertisements than on research and development: <http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001> Excluding direct-to-consumer advertising, CAM considers that around 80% of the remaining promotion is directed towards physicians, with 20% of this figure going to pharmacists. (IMS does not provide any comparable values.) With about 700,000 practicing physicians in the US in 2004 [20], we estimate that with a total expenditure of US$57.5 billion, the industry spent around US$61,000 in promotion per physician. **As a percentage of US domestic sales of US$235.4 billion [21], promotion consumes 24.4% of the sales dollar versus 13.4% for R&D.**
pharmaceutical companies in Canada spend 1-2x more on research and development than on advertising: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5848527/> Depending on the method used to determine promotion spending, industry-wide the ratio of R&D spending to promotion ranges from 1.45 to 2.18 (sales representatives and journal advertising only) or from 0.88 to 1.32 (total promotion spending estimated based 2003-2005 data.) For the individual companies promoting one or more of the 50 most promoted drugs, 2.11 to 2.32 times more is spent on R&D compared to promotion. However these results should be interpreted cautiously because of data limitations.

This is independent of whether they choose to enter it (although the PS data show that on average they do so enter it); because of their level of nonlabour income, they are genuinely free to choose whether or not to take employment. Call this capitalist-managerial class "quasi-capitalist managers" or "Qc managers" for short. Managers who are in a structurally different position, being forced to sell their labour-power, are noncapitalist-managers. Still managers, with supervisory responsibilities in production, they are not free to choose whether or not to take employment, because they do not have sufficient assets to generate a nonlabour income enabling them not to enter the labour market. Hence call them "labour-power dependent managers" or "Lpd managers" for short.

# causes: inheritance
inheritance (rather than merit) is the largest cause for intergenerational wealth: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w21409> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/537336813073727498/unknown.png While we have added fewer than 100 extra adoptive families to the sample, we still find a statistically significant interaction effect of 0.40. This suggests that the rank correlation with adoptive parent wealth increases from 0.23 to 0.63 once inheritances are included.39 This large effect is consistent with the findings of Adermon et al. (2016) who use wealth and inheritances data and find that inheritance appears to be the most important component of the intergenerational wealth elasticity in Sweden.
higher-income people are more likely to inherit wealth, and more likely to inherit more wealth, than lower-income people: <https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/bns/bn192.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564452559310553098/unknown.png

# causes: direct transfers
direct transfers probably account for most of the correlation between parent and child wealth: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w21409> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/537336682807296050/unknown.png Column 6 of Table 5 presents the estimates when we control for all these possible mechanisms together. All together, we can explain almost 50% of the effect of the biological parent’s wealth effect on children’s wealth, while we are able to explain only a bit more than 20% of the adoptive parent’s wealth effect. 47 Given that most of the environmental effect remains unexplained by earnings, savings rates, and investment returns, direct financial transfers from parents to children are a likely explanation for much of the environmental effect. 48 However, we do not have data on financial transfers that would allow us to study this directly.

# causes: genetics
just 11% of wealth rank can be explained by genetics: <https://www.nber.org/papers/w21409> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/529171280109240321/unknown.png Using the simplest behavioral genetics model – the ACE model (Cesarini et al., 2010; Cronqvist and Siegel, 2015) – the proportion of the variance due to shared environment equals the first correlation and the proportion of the variance due to genetics equals twice the difference between the second correlation and the first. **We find that, for net wealth, the first correlation is 0.288 (0.047) and the second correlation is 0.343 (0.001) implying that the shared environmental component accounts for 29% and the genetic component for 11% of the variance of the rank of net wealth of children.** This finding is consistent with our main results using regression analysis.

# solutions: education
intergenerational immobility of education can be decreased by larger teacher payscales, higher unemployment replacement rate, higher tax progressivity, higher enrollment in preschoool, less tracking (ie, less nonuniform education), and lower enrollment in vocational school: <https://www.oecd.org/centrodemexico/medios/44582910.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/535566414648705026/unknown.png
education reduces inequality: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/joes.12056> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/536584643957227530/unknown.png The conditional MRA predictions reported in Table 3 suggest that education has had no effect on average levels of inequality when measured by the Gini coefficient. However, the MRA also indicates that education has led to a compression in incomes: it has resulted in reduced income inequality at both ends of the income distribution. The results also suggest that compared to primary schooling, secondary schooling and educational attainment are more effective at reducing inequality.

income inequality hurts economic growth: <http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/trends-in-income-inequality-and-its-impact-on-economic-growth-SEM-WP163.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1467-9485.2008.00470.x> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/440348220963553281/unknown.png
meta-analysis finds that inequality has a weak negative effect on growth: <http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/handle/1871/21747/SJPE%20Dominicis.pdf> The use of fixed-effects estimators or the inclusion of regional-specific dummies in the regressions has a similar effect of reducing the negative impact of inequality on growth in the cross-section estimates, and of accentuating the positive effect in studies based on pooled data. In accordance with Barro (2000), we found that the correlation between growth and income inequality is different in rich as compared to poor countries. The negative impact of an uneven distribution of income is higher in less developed countries. [....] The longer the length of the growth period (ie, from 5 to 10 to 20 years), the lower the coefficient estimates of the correlation between income and economic growth [become]. This result supports the assertion that the mechanism at the basis of the relationship between inequality and growth works differently in the short run as compared to the long run. We also found that the quality of data on income inequality and economic growth is weaker, regardless whether the correlation is estimated to be positive or negative.
meta-analysis finds that inequality has a weak negative effect on growth, and that wealth inequality has a stronger effect: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X15002600> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.038> ```After correcting for these two forms of publication bias, we investigated the sources of heterogeneity by means of a metaregression. As in Dominicis et al.’s (2008) our results suggest that for a 5% level of significance: the effect of inequality on growth is negative and more pronounced in less developed countries than in rich countries; the inclusion of regional dummies in the growth regression of the primary studies considerably weakens such effect; expenditure and gross income inequality tend to lead to different estimates of the effect size. However, contrary to it Dominicis et al. (2008), we find that: the impact of inequality on growth is not significantly influenced by the quality of the data on income distribution or by the use of different panel estimation techniques; crosssection studies systematically report a stronger negative impact than panel data studies. Furthermore, our results suggest that wealth inequality is more pernicious to subsequent growth than income inequality is. With the exception of the impact of using expenditure versus gross income, all these results are robust.```

# effects: crime
income inequality explains most of the homicide differences between Canadian provinces, between US states, and between Canada and the US: <https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-99209-003> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639976333593804814/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639976597402681366/unknown.png Comparison across the Canadian provinces provides a test case in which average income and the Gini are, instead, positively correlated, and we find that the positive relationship between the Gini and the homicide rate is undiminished. Temporal change in the Gini is also shown to be a significant predictor of temporal change in provincial homicide rates. When Canadian provinces and U.S. states are considered together, local levels of income inequality appear to be sufficient to account for the two countries' radically different national homicide rates.
income inequality between neighborhoods strongly predicts property crime: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0042098016643914> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1177/0042098016643914> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639981935279472690/10.png The average total impact of a 1% increase in the percentage of households under the poverty line is estimated to have a 0.48% increase in the block group property crime rate. The average total impact of a 1% increase in the percentage of high income households is estimated to have a 0.81% decrease in the block group property crime rate. The average total impact of a 1% increase in the income difference from the poorest neighbouring block group is estimated to have a 0.25% increase in the block group property crime rate. These marginal effects are of similar magnitude as in the previous OLS model.
higher income inequality significantly predicts higher homicide and lower trust: <https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/21/2/241/498070> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639982730985340948/unknown.png The association between income inequality and homicide (Path c) was statistically significant; each SD increase in income inequality corresponded to 0.82 SD increase in homicide. Associations between income inequality and trust, and between trust and homicide, were also significant. Each SD increase in income inequality corresponded to a 0.65 SD decrease in trust, and each SD increase in trust corresponded to a 0.58 SD decrease in homicide.

cooperative logging enterprises and unionized logging enterprises are more productive than traditional logging enterprises: <https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1995/01/1995_bpeamicro_craig.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/470302676299808788/unknown.png In table 3, average values of output per worker-hour (labor productivity) are consistently higher for the classical firms, but there is little difference between the co-ops and the unionized mills. By contrast, average values of output per log input (material productivity) are usually higher for the co-ops and the unionized mills and lowest for the classical mills. This implies quite different labor-log ratios as shown in the last line: computed over all production types, the average ratio of worker-hours to log inputs in cooperative and unionized mills is more than double its value in classical mills. These differences in input ratios are less marked in mills specializing in plywood and in veneer production. Output per size of largest lathe (XIK) is consistently highest among the unionized mills and usually lowest among the classical mills.

right to work laws directly increase occupational deaths: <https://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2018/06/13/oemed-2017-104747> Methods Two-way fixed effects regression models are used to estimate the effect of unionisation on occupational mortality per 100 000 workers, controlling for state policy liberalism and workforce composition over the period 1992–2016. In the final specification, RTW laws are used as an instrument for unionisation to recover causal effects. Results The Local Average Treatment Effect of a 1% decline in unionisation attributable to RTW is about a 5% increase in the rate of occupational fatalities. In total, RTW laws have led to a 14.2% increase in occupational mortality through decreased unionisation.

Olsen 2013 argues that "financing constraints" because of lender reluctance and lack of collateral and "elevated early risk" because firms are usually entirely worker-funded (ie, high liability) cause cooperatives to be formed less than conventional enterprises: <https://community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/article-olsen.pdf>

# business cycle theory & savings rate: theory
Hayekian theory ignores the fact that businesses largely ignore the savings rate for day-to-day operations: <https://danielpkuehn.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/abct-article-for-critical-review.pdf> A more substantial rebuttal to Hayek’s concerns about a distorted capital structure is offered by Tullock (1987), who objects to the whole idea that firms care much about interest rates in determining the volume of production. Hayek’s theory requires that an artificially low interest rate makes production that takes a longer time more profitable than it otherwise would be, but if interest costs are not even considered by firms the whole theory falls apart. [....] He further noted that the reason why firms ignore interest rates in production decisions is that even highly capital intensive production processes (after all capital equipment has been acquired and installed) do not usually take a substantial amount of time to complete. Tullock’s experience with interest rates anticipates a finding by Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (2000) that as long as inflation is modest, firms ignore it in their decision making. Although entrepreneurial responses to interest rate variations (in Tullock’s case) or low inflation (in Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry’s case) need not be identical, the common conclusion of this and other behavioral research seems to be that these sorts of minor costs are discounted in the decision making process relative to larger concerns. If interest rates and inflation fail to drive distortionary production decisions it is hard to see why a market correction would be inevitable or even necessary. Interest rates are still critical for large capital expenditures, but the widely cited empirical work of Davis, Haltiwanger, and Schuh (1996) suggests that most job creation and destruction happens at large, mature establishments which are presumably primarily making capacity utilization decisions rather than new capital expenditure decisions.
Hayekian theory predicts that consumption and investment move oppositely; they move together: <https://danielpkuehn.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/abct-article-for-critical-review.pdf> Cowen (1997) points out that over the business cycle, investment and consumption move together, a phenomenon he refers to as “co-movement”. [...] Hayek’s theory predicts that investment and consumption should move in opposite directions over the business cycle[.] [...] First, Prices and Production assumed that the economy starts in a position of full employment before the unsustainable boom begins. [...] [S]ince the economy is operating at capacity any increase in capital goods production has to come at the expense of consumer goods production. [...] [Second,] the upper-turning point [...] accounts for the end of the boom with the Ricardian assumption that capital intensification occurs at the expense of labor income, and that this tension between capital and labor ends the boom. [....] Garrison (2000, 2004) provides a supply-side response by assuming that capital intensive production processes are more productive than labor intensive production processes, so the move to capital intensive processes can accommodate a simultaneous increase in consumption and investment. [....] Hayek clearly expected a movement of consumption and investment in opposite directions: “an increase in the demand for consumer goods will tend to decrease rather than increase the demand for investment goods” [...] [I]f Garrison [...] is accurate, it is not clear what needs to be rebalanced in a market correction (i.e., a recession). [...] [T]he upper turning point occurred precisely because of this tension between consumption and investment. If that tension is explained away [...] then [...] the inevitable bust is explained away as well.

# business cycle theory & savings rate: empirics
Hayekian theory predicts that "boom size" should predict "bust size"; it does not: <https://danielpkuehn.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/abct-article-for-critical-review.pdf> <http://bruegel.org/2015/02/the-plucking-model-of-recessions-and-recoveries/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553972596367163392/unknown.png Another cutting critique grounded in an assessment of how well Hayek’s theory fits the data is Milton Friedman’s (1969, 1993) “plucking model” of the business cycle. [....] A correlation between the depth of a recession and the height of the subsequent boom would strongly imply that recessions are the consequence of a shock that had nothing to do with the preceding growth period, and that the recovery was just a reversion of the economy back to its stable growth path. Friedman found that in a data series going back to the late nineteenth century recession depths were correlated with the subsequent boom and not the prior boom. He called this the “plucking model” because it implied that recessions were caused by plucking the economy down from an otherwise steady growth path. In many ways, Friedman’s simple empirical exercise offers the greatest blow to Hayek of all the criticisms discussed here. A theory of the unsustainable boom is of little use if busts are not caused by booms.
Hayekian theory poorly predicts recessions; neither tight or loose monetary policy, relative to the "natural" rate of interest, consistently precedes or postcedes recessions: <https://danielpkuehn.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/abct-article-for-critical-review.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553974446269136914/unknown.png Figure 2, below, subtracts the real federal funds rate from this estimated natural rate. If this difference is equal to zero, then the actual federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve is equal to the best estimate of the natural rate of interest, and monetary policy is neutral. A positive value for the difference indicates tight monetary policy, while a negative value indicates loose monetary policy. Vertical lines are provided to indicate the start date of recessions, as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research. [....] The recessions of the 1960s and 1970s at least have the virtue of exhibiting the pro-cyclical (albeit persistently loose) monetary stance required by Hayek. Far less is available for Austrians to work with in the case of the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, which were not preceded by any monetary loosening at all. Regardless of the actual level of the real interest rate, if this rate is not below the natural rate – if monetary policy is not expansionary – there can be no unsustainable boom according to Hayekian business cycle theory. [....] Hayekians who think that the capital structure lengthens and contracts with the price signals sent by monetary policy are confronted with an awkward question: exactly what were entrepreneurs doing between 2005-06 and 2008? [....] Given the weak evidence for Hayek’s unsustainable boom, it seems far more plausible that Keynesian (or monetarist) forces drive the business cycle, and that the capital structure – behaving in an otherwise purely Hayekian manner – lengthens and contracts as a consequence the of the business cycle, rather than as its cause.
Austrian theory's predictions are opposite in sign to the (statistically insignificant) empirical results: <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11293-014-9415-5.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/553983169938849793/unknown.png With the exception of early- to middle-stage prices, which responded positively to the productivity gap but negatively to TGt, the responses depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 are qualitatively similar. For the most part, the responses of the four ratios are small, statistically insignificant, and of the opposite sign as that predicted by the Austrian theory. From this, we conclude that our results are robust to selection of a measure of the natural rate and, accordingly, are more confident in our assessment that the available data provides little empirical support for the Austrian business cycle theory.

# praxeology & anti-empiricism
Austrian economists assert that "praxeology" (ie, deductive 'logic' about how they think humans *actually* behave) should take preference over statistical measures of how humans actually behave. For example, this economist suggest that, if the statistics are different than the theoretical predictions, **we should change the statistics**: <https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae10_2_4_2.pdf> Only partly tongue in cheek, I think it is legitimate to use Austrian praxeological principles to clarify some of the existing statistical mayhem. To illustrate, accept the Austrian proposition that wages are determined by the marginal productivity of labor. The rate of growth in aggregate prices over time, then, would equal that growth necessary to be consistent with this Austrian proposition. If Bosh's 1.1 point adjustment to the CPI leads to wage growth exceeding productivity change, while no adjustment leads to productivity changes exceeding wage growth, **the correct adjustment is one that equates these two measures, perhaps 0.5 or 0.7 percentage points.**
Austrian economists assert that free markets are, **by definition**, economically efficient -- and that measuring them isn't worth the time. <https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae10_2_4_2.pdf> ``Even accepting the dominant method of modern economics, and believing that the use of empirical means to verify or falsify economic hypotheses is valid, the reality of data aggregation problems makes empirical exercises a hazardous and often dubious enterprise. On basic theoretical grounds, the problems of generalizing with any precision about the magnitude of price changes are substantial. In Rothbard's (1993) "evenly rotating economy" with freely operating market forces, the issue of aggregate economic performance is one that is either irrelevant or of a second order of importance. If economic agents are freely expressing their economic will in their decision making, the existing level of economic performance is optimal, and whether it is larger or smaller than in other time periods is not very important.``
Austrian economists suggest that, because different datasets can lead one to different conclusions, that means that data collection itself is flawed. For example: <https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae10_2_4_2.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542208108231917590/unknown.png
fundamentally, Austrians simply don't trust the government and do trust private entities: <https://mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/rae10_2_4_2.pdf> ``Moreover, the private economy in its planning wants, and is willing to pay, to get some aggregate economic data, even mediocre data. That explains why otherwise sensible businessmen pay economists to do forecasts. If GDP didn't exist, someone would invent it. The statistical mayhem described above suggests that one can find data to support almost any economic theory. The notion that mainstream economists practice science while Austrian economists are more like theologians is, at the very least, an exaggeration. Many mainstream economists selectively use data to defend preconceived positions. They try to add legitimacy to often bankrupt intellectual positions by invoking the mantle of science. On average, I think, Austrians are more straightforward and intellectually honest. The moral of my little story, then, is: beware, government statistics may be injurious to your economic health. Eat them gingerly and with suspicion, as Austrian economists have long done. Indeed, when it comes to government statistics, ignorance often may well be bliss.``
Mises famously rejected statistical measures of economic performance. To quote: <https://mises.org/library/human-action-0/html/pp/730> In the field of praxeology and economics no sense can be given to the notion of measurement. In the hypothetical state of rigid conditions there are no changes to be measured. In the actual world of change there are no fixed points, dimensions, or relations which could serve as a standard. The monetary unit's purchasing power never changes evenly with regard to all things vendible and purchasable. The notions of stability and stabilization are empty if they do not refer to a state of rigidity and its preservation. However, this state of rigidity cannot even be thought out consistently to its ultimate logical consequences; still less can it be realized5. [....] The pretentious solemnity which statisticians and statistical bureaus display in computing indexes of purchasing power and cost of living is out of place. These index numbers are at best rather crude and inaccurate illustrations of changes which have occurred. In periods of slow alterations in the relation between the supply of and the demand for money they do not convey any information at all. In periods of inflation and consequently of sharp price changes they provide a rough image of events which every individual experiences in his daily life. A judicious housewife knows much more about price changes as far as they affect her own household than the statistical [p. 223] averages can tell. She has little use for computations disregarding changes both in quality and in the amount of goods which she is able or permitted to buy at the prices entering into the computation. If she "measures" the changes for her personal appreciation by taking the prices of only two or three commodities as a yardstick, she is no less "scientific" and no more arbitrary than the sophisticated mathematicians in choosing their methods for the manipulation of the data of the market.

# post-scarcity
marx on post-scarcity society: <http://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf> Labour no longer appears so much to be included within the production process; rather, the human being comes to relate more as watchman and regulator to the production process itself. [...] He steps to the side of the production process instead of being its chief actor. **In this transformation, it is neither the direct human labour he himself performs, nor the time during which he works, but rather the appropriation of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his mastery over it** by virtue of his presence as a social body – it is, in a word, the development of the social individual which appears as the great foundation-stone of production and of wealth. [...] The free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them. **Capital itself is the moving contradiction, [in] that it presses to reduce labour time to a minimum, while it posits labour time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth.** [...] Forces of production and social relations – two different sides of the development of the social individual – appear to capital as mere means, and are merely means for it to produce on its limited foundation. In fact, however, they are the material conditions to blow this foundation sky-high. ‘Truly wealthy a nation, when the working day is 6 rather than 12 hours. Wealth is not command over surplus labour time’ (real wealth), ‘but rather, disposable time outside that needed in direct production, for every individual and the whole society.’

The USSR barely prioritized efficiency, and it resulted in much less efficient production: <http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191111115222/http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae1f7e792.pdf> But, as pointed out by Nove (1972, p. 336), in the USSR, “such problems as training factory labor and building great new industrial complexes, seemed much more important than ‘efficiency’, or replacing machines by better machines”. Thus, improving the ‘efficiency’ of already installed productive capacity was not a priority of the Soviet economic system, at least until the 1970’s. In almost all the sectors of the Soviet economy, every unit of output used to demand more resources to be produced than in the Western industrialized countries. For example, the average quantity of raw materials and energy necessary to produce the same final good were, respectively, 1.6 and 2.1 times greater than in the United States in the 1970s (GAIDAR, 2007, p. 75). This situation was not due to an intrinsic ‘inefficiency’ of the central planning system. Actually, the ‘efficiency’ of installed productive capacity in the USSR was affected by the militarization of the economy, by the deterioration of the ‘discipline’ of Soviet workers and by the extreme climatic conditions in much of the country.

# poverty
the USSR's ideology made begging reduction much more difficult: <https://www.cairn-int.info/article-E_ANNA_682_0357--the-excluded.htm> Official rhetoric considered begging -- along with other social deviancies -- as a “vestige of the past,” destined to disappear with the construction of Socialist society. The idea of “construction” presupposed a concerted fight against these “vestiges.” Those who transmitted these values were stigmatized for being “socially excluded elements” or “parasites” who should be “re-educated,” either voluntarily or by force. [....] Entire segments of the population were excluded because of their social origins, political loyalties, or lack of experience. [....] As the last foundations of Socialism were being laid, the reality of begging contradicted official declarations concerning the national eradication of poverty (nishcheta). Begging was henceforth considered an avatar of “parasitic” existence, a phenomenon with no social or economic justification in the Soviet Union, a simple outcome of human vice. [....] Ideology was another systemic constraint. Belief in the superiority of Socialism over Capitalism, particularly regarding social benefits and quality of life, prevented an appropriate analysis of reality. These systemic constraints dominated both governmental and social discourse. [....] Soviet society was based on the principle of exclusion on several levels. When the authorities gave the signal to “exclude” someone, society reacted accordingly, chasing from their midst those “enemies of the people,” the “rootless cosmopolitans,” the “parasites,” and the “good-for-nothings.”

# bad decisions
Weitzman-Easterly-Fisher hypothesis (rejected by Allen): tfp growth did not slow -- return to capital slowed from insufficient labor: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641076509414522911/unknown.png Productivity in these arguments was calculated with a standard Cobb-Douglas framework with constant factor shares like those in the West. Weitzman 1970 challenged this interpretation by estimating a production function for the USSR. He concluded that the Cobb-Douglas specification was incorrect, and that the Soviet experience was better represented by a CES function with an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour of .4. In this framework, the growth deceleration is due to diminishing returns to capital; there is not evidence of a fall in TFP growth. The growth slowdown, in other words, does not indicate poor institutional performance. Easterley and Fisher have redone the econometrics with more recent data and confirmed the elasticity of substitution. They have been reluctant, however, to exonerate Soviet institutions. [....] One indicator of the change is unfilled vacancies on the first shift, which rose from 1 per cent in 1960, to 4.9 per cent in 1970, to 7.3 per cent in 1975, then to 9.9 per cent in 1980, and finally hit 12.2 per cent in 1985 Rumer 1989, 199–200. In the 1970s a Gosplan research director reported that 10–12 per cent of the increment in real fixed capital was unutilized, owing to a shortage of labour Rumer 1989, 202. and that proportion could only have increased in the 1980s. The capital stock rose without a corresponding rise in GDP because there was no labour to operate the new capacity.
Allen hypothesis: Weitzman’s econometrics imply a value of 0.403 – a figure confirmed by Easterly and Fischer ~1995, 357! for the whole economy. But 0.4 is an unusually low value. Evidence for Japan and other advanced capitalist economies suggests a value of 1.0 or even greater ~Easterly and Fischer 1995, 359–61; Duffy and Papageorgiou 2000!. While simulations using an elasticity of substitution of 0.403 imply a growth slowdown, simulations with a value of 1.0 do not. With more substitutability between capital and labour, diminishing returns to capital are not substantial enough to cause stagnation, and this is why a high investment rate paid off in Japan but not in the USSR. [....] Weitzman and Easterly and Fischer speculate on reasons why the elasticity of substitution might have been lower in the USSR than elsewhere, without coming to firm conclusions. This is good; for, I will argue, the value of 0.4 is an illusion. The low measured value of the elasticity reflects massive errors in Soviet investment strategy rather than a real difference in technology. It was not purely happenstance that these errors occurred in the 1970s and 1980s; for the end of the surplus labour economy posed new management problems, and the party leadership bungled them.

The first global civilian computer networks developed among cooperative capitalists, not among competitive socialists. The capitalists behaved like socialists while the socialists behaved like capitalists.

# planning
the USSR's non-mathematical, "command economy" planning was unable to handle increasingly complex production chains: <https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/sovietplanningltc_seongjin_urpe20180928.pdf> Stalinist planners tried to resolve the problem of complexity inherent in a planned economy by concentrating on a limited number of sectors. Indeed, Gosplan planned only a few strategic industries, targeting the ministries and not individual companies. [....] In 1951, Gosplan’s Five-Year Plan was compiled for 127 products, while material balances, the main tool of planning, were prepared for 60 products, although there were millions of products in contemporary Russia (Gregory, 2004: 117, 152). [....] Accurate techniques like input-output tables or optimal linear programming, which could balance supply and demand, were never applied to Stalinist planning. Gosplan planned to produce goods or services on an aggregated, rather than disaggregated basis, so balancing the national economy through consistent planning was impossible from the start. In fact, Stalinist planning was not meant to achieve a balanced national economy: unbalanced growth was not a problem to be avoided but tolerated and even promoted.
the USSR's incentives system encouraged playing it safe, not playing it well: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> From the point of view of suppliers, the willingness of Soviet managers to pursue costs savings through asset replacement is deterred by what a leading Soviet investment expert terms "self reproduction", the propensity toward the perpetuation of existing technology, which has assured sources of material supply and provides near-certain production bonuses. [....] Reliance on longstanding sources of materials supply to insure against external (to the enterprise or ministry) supply disruptions also slows technical advance.3 2 Centralized planning promises a producer an adequate allocation of necessary inputs but provides no guarantee of timely and sufficient delivery. As a result, a good deal of Soviet machinery is produced in small machine shops attached to the consuming organization rather than in large-scale machinebuilding ministries. Only the specialized ministries, however, can afford to support the research and testing facilities required to develop advanced technology. To the degree that the propensity toward vertical integration (self-sufficiency) prevails, Soviet industry forgoes the benefits of division of labor that characterize modern industry in market economies. [....] Technological backwardness is also explained by insufficient supplier initiative. In market economies, most technical progress at the plant level originates in sales pressure by equipment suppliers. The basic Soviet shortcoming is institutional. In the Soviet system, research and development is separated originally from production. The incentives for R&D organizations reward expenditures of budget allocations more than completion of projects or the satisfaction of consumer demand.

# intensive and extensive growth
until the 1980's, the USSR did not prioritize "intensive" growth: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> As both Soviet and Western observers of Soviet economic development have repeatedly said,' the traditional Soviet approach to growth has stressed the rapid infusion of labor, fixed capital, and raw materials into industry. Compared with the path followed by industrializing market economies, there has been proportionately far less effort to increase the productivity of either existing or new manpower and capital assets. Since 1960, the USSR-among the major industrial economies-has experienced the most rapid growth of employment and, along with Japan, the fastest growth of fixed capital stock. In sharp contrast, the Soviet Union has shown the lowest rate of increase in both labor and capital productivity (table 1). In official Soviet jargon the traditional approach is termed "extensive" and the alternative path of stress upon productivity as "intensive". While Soviet planners have continually accorded lip service to productivity objectives under the rubric of "hidden production reserves", they have embraced intensive development as a major policy focus only within the past decade.
as a result, the USSR invested little into factory and machine replacement or modernization: <https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> In the mid-1970's, 56 percent of U.S. industrial investment was directed toward replacement and modernization. In the Soviet Union the proportion was only 29 percent in the late 1970's. While the U.S. proportion may be too high a standard for the Soviet Union, given slower U.S. industrial growth, some Soviet economists had recommended that the Soviet share should be doubled or tripled. The replacement share has in fact been steadily rising during the 1981-85 Five Year Plan, reaching 35 percent in 1984. [....] The advantages of an intensified replacement effort are several fold, according to special surveys carried out in the USSR. Labor productivity is said to be about 50 percent and capital productivity 86 percent higher than in new plant construction. These results reportedly were attained with cost savings of one half to two-thirds and with capacity being brought on stream 3-3.5 times as rapidly. [....] The accelerated retirement guidelines adopted in 1975, as noted earlier, have not been implemented. Official retirements for wear and tear, as reported in the annual statistical handbook, have shown no significant change. [....] During the 1970's the average age (number of years in production) of current machinery output rose significantly. The share of new products fell from 4.3 to 2.5 percent while the share of machinery in production for more than 10 years climbed from 20 to 28 percent.

# research and development: military spending
military research remained innovative while civilian research fell behind: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> The increase in defence spending may have lowered productivity growth, however, by diverting R&D resources from civilian to military innovation. It is difficult to measure the rate of invention, but the available indicators suggest that it was declining in the USSR, at least for the civilian economy. The Soviets did publish considerable statistics on the number of new prototypes brought into use. While such numbers are always hard to interpret, Kontorovich ~1987, 1990! has argued that they indicate the volume of newly available technologies, and Amann ~1986! has pressed them into service. They show a decline in the absolute number of new inventions brought into use each year from the 1960s to 1985. Kontorovich ~1990, 267! has divided them into civilian and military innovations and argued that the fall was largely confined to the civilian sector. [....] If the Cold War was responsible for the drop in Soviet productivity growth, then it accounts for over half of the Soviet growth slowdown. TFP growth dropped from 1.5 per cent per year to 20.5 per cent between the 1960s and 1980–85. Reversing the productivity slowdown by adding 2 per cent to the 1980–85 GNP growth rate increases the latter from 2 to 4 per cent per year. This is still less than the 5.7 per cent growth of the 1960s, but certainly is a much better performance.
between 1950 and 1990, the USSR spent 10-20% of its GDP each year on defense (about 2x that of the USA):<https://nintil.com/2016/05/31/the-soviet-union-military-spending/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/594582157100580886/defchart.png
<https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/100th%20Congress/Gorbachev's%20Economic%20Plan%20Volume%20I%20(1438).pdf> The explanations for lagging Soviet technological progress, with its unfavorable consequences for the policy of intensive development, lie mainly in managerial incentives, the institutio nal relationships between research and development and production, and the technological drain imposed the priority given to defense production. Technological progress in market economies depends upon both consumer and supplier initiatives. In the Soviet system, the influence of the consumer is weak, except in defense production where the initiative comes from the Ministry of Defense with reinforcement from the top leadership.
about half of research and development funds and about half of new machine tools went to the defence industry: <https://www.amazon.com/Victory-Administrations-Strategy-Hastened-Collapse/dp/0871136333> The eleventh five-year plan that was being developed by the CPSU reflected this preoccupation and concern. It gave a very high priority for overcoming the perceived lag with the West in electronics. The plan called for a rise in output of industrial robots from 13,000 to 28,000 and machine tool development centers from 2,500 to 10,700. In the first two years of the new plan, investment in engineering-sector facilities for research and development, testing, and evaluation was said to be 50 percent above the funding for the whole of the previous five years. And R&D funds were to be especially concentrated on high-tech projects. **The trouble was that the best Soviet resources in the field were being directed toward the military-industrial base. Half of the machine tools were going to defense enterprises, which also employed the best scientists. At least half of all research and development expenditures were for the military. And the Reagan defense buildup—particularly its emphasis on emerging technologies—meant that more resources needed to be shifted to defense.** [....] The temper of the times meant that Gorbachev would be devoting even more to defense than had been the case in the past. The new five-year plan called for more spending on advanced weapons. **As Gorbachev would later admit, the planned rate of growth for defense in 1986 through 1990 was almost 8 percent per year, twice the rate of national income growth.22 All told, defense expenditures would rise an astonishing 45 percent in the next five years.**

nutrition quality went up after the 1917 revolution (including collectivization), according to conscript height data: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03017605.2016.1268454> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/540415342892285962/unknown.png For the Russian/Soviet data the actual historical trend is a matter of some dispute. Our evidence seems to support the conclusions of Allen rather than those of Wheatcroft. When two independent sources of investigation—deconvolution of adult heights on the one hand and Allen’s indices of wages and prices on the other, mutually agree, the plausibility of each is reinforced. Given however, that the deconvolution technique is new in the field, we have presented a second study using completely different data from Austria. Again we find that the inferred food availability from deconvolution conforms plausibly to other historical sources. We have come to the conclusion that it is possible to use of deconvolution to infer past diets.
from 1960 to 1985, the USSR and USA had about equal median higher caloric intake: <https://nintil.com/2016/05/11/the-soviet-union-food/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/562946516906409984/unknown.png

# economic disimportance
Stalin was not necessary: collectivization accounts for just 12.5% of the USSR's economic growth between 1928 and 1939 (and most of that was because terror moved peasants into the cities; 82.5% of the gorwth is explained by high capital reinvestment and soft budgets: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3131928.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/0008-4085.00103> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/589762090332585985/unknown.png The simulations show that collectivization had a nega- tive effect on all indicators - GDP, investment, consumption, and, of course, pop- ulation - in the mid-1930s. However, collectivization pushed up the growth rate enough in the rest of the decade to raise GDP, capital accumulation, and consump- tion above the 1939 levels they would have realized had the agrarian system of the 1920s been preserved. Collectivization raised growth by increasing rural-urban migra- tion: First, low procurement prices lowered farm incomes below the level they would have otherwise reached. Migration increased in consequence, since it was a function of the ratio of urban to rural income. Second, the deportation of 'kulaks' and state terrorism in general increased the rate of rural-urban migration at every ratio of urban to rural consumption. Terrorism increased economic growth to that small degree.

# censorship
Stalin's ascent corresponded with the termination of the socialist planning debate: <https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/sovietplanningltc_seongjin_urpe20180928.pdf> All the debates on planning during the NEP suddenly stopped with Stalin’s counterrevolution in 1929. In 1931 Stalin purged and executed most of the planning experts, such as Kondratiev, Chayanov, Groman, Ginzberg, Rubin et al., branding them as Menshevik counterrevolutionaries. [...] Stalin himself discarded *The Balance of the National Economy of the USSR, 1923–24* as just “juggling with figures” (Stalin, 1954a: 178), signaling the physical termination of planning specialists. Ironically, the so-called Stalinist planned economy was born on the corpses of almost all the contemporary Marxist planners.

# mobility
the societies of the USSR and Eastern Bloc had higher mobility before the transition from the communist era to the capitalist era: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562416302104> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564802213826789406/unknown.png The hypothesis regarding the effect of the transition  on intergenerational inequality in educational attainment is tested by introducing a dummy variable for the transitional cohort, and its interaction terms with parental education and occupational social class. With this regression specification in Model 4, Table 2, coefficients for social origins refer to the communist period. The characteristics of Model 3, particularly in terms of parental education, are largely maintained for individuals born between 1958 and 1972, which suggests that **there have not been radical changes in intergenerational social mobility patterns in post-communist societies**. Still, the coefficients for social origins and their interactions with the transitional cohort indicate that intergenerational inequality in educational attainment has been affected in the following ways: the interaction term between primary education and transitional cohort is statistically significant and has negative sign, which suggests that **the disadvantage associated with low parental education intensified in post-communist societies**. Nonetheless, the tertiary education-transitional cohort interaction coefficient indicates that **the advantage of having parents with a high level of education was simultaneously reduced**. Related trends are observed in relation to parental social class. In this case, the positive effect of salariat origin on individuals’ educational attainment declined, but the negative effect of working class origin intensified. In other words, **the gap between individuals from working and intermediate class origin widened during the transition**. This is in line with existing evidence that indicates that the workers were in privileged conditions in the communist era but that their situation deteriorated thereafter (Eyal and Townsley, 1995, Szelenyi, 2002).

It is smaller than those for Japan, the UK or US, but larger than for others, particularly the Scandinavian countries. [....] It seems that the attempt by women to cope with their 'dobule burden' by working fewer hours was encouraged by wage policies for a key category of workers. This -- very partial -- alleviation of the 'double burden' should be seen in the context of the 'demographic problem' -- the great concern of the Soviet leadership about low birth-rates in the 1960's and 1970's, and the simultaneous need for highly educated female labor power. Fundamental change in gender roles and in the gender division of labour, including that in the household, was never seriously proposed (Posadskaya, 1994). Feminism remained a heresy, and the increase in quality and quantity of household goods and public services, constantly promised to Soviet women, remained a dream. [....] Formally, the Soviet wage-system was based on productivity -- schooling, skill, efficiency, and 'importance for the national economy'. Yet, there appears to be a systematic undervalution of work considered to be 'feminine'.

the emergency medicine of the USSR was extremely high quality: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10282748> <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jack_Salmon/publication/13015404_Anomalies_in_Soviet_healthcare/links/55c95b6e08aeb97567478155.pdf> The emergency part of the ambulance system, the "Skoraya Pomosch", is comprised of specially equipped ambulances staffed by a physician, a feldsher, and a specially trained driver. These vehicles, radioconnected through a dispatch center, are even specialzied by cardiovascular, pediatric, psychiatric, neurological, and gynecological services. The ambulance system purports to be able to reach any citizen within 15 minutes in every major metropolitan area in the Soviet Union and within 25 minutes in most rural areas. In 1983, in Sochi, a Black Sea resort attracting 4 million vacationers per year, over 215,000 calls were received and answered within an average of 4 minutes[.]

# inequality

Class levels of medical care are represented in distinct systems, and variations in quality exist between hospitals and polyclinics for high level government officials, research institutes and teaching hospitals, other urban facilities, and outlying rural hospitals. Members of the Communist Party, residents of large urban areas, particularly Moscow, and those who hold the more privileged positions in the society have access to a series of polyclinics and hospitals that are superior to others in the country.

USA 1960: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193636/> More than 70 percent of the population had some form of hospital insurance by 1965 (though less than one-half of the elderly population did), 67 percent had surgical insurance, and there was a growing market for major medical insurance (Health Insurance Institute, 1980). But few were insured for primary or out-of-hospital care. Of the members of the general population who reported they had “pains in the heart,” 25 percent did not see a physician (Andersen and Anderson, 1967).
starting in the 1960's, the USSR's healthcare system was unable to handle chronic illnesses and faced systemic underfunding, shortages: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/73aiiu/what_was_healthcare_like_in_the_soviet_union/> <http://archive.is/qMwgJ> [W]hile the early Soviet healthcare system (early in this case largely means pre-WWII, and sometimes even pre-1930) was well prepared to deal with fractured bones and cholera, it was poorly equipped to deal with complicated conditions and mental illnesses. This approach, however, still allowed Russian (as it varied between national republics) life-expectancy to peak at or around 70 years in the mid 1960s, not far from the Western European averages at the time. This translates to around 64 years for men and 73 years for women (with the corresponding figures for France and the US in 1965 being approximately 67.5 and 66.8 for men, and 74.7 and 73.7 for women respectively). [....] From that point onward сardiovascular diseases became one of the primary causes of non-violent death in the Soviet Union. This is the trend that was noted across the industrialized world, with low rates of infectious diseases, and growing rates of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. [...] Increases in substance abuse also started to take a toll. The amount of resources devoted to healthcare did not increase accordingly (it is estimated that it stayed relatively constant at around 2-3% between 1960 and 1970). In comparison, in United States it increased from 5% in 1960, to around 8% in 1983. As a result of that, as well as the start of the decline of the Soviet economy as a whole, in the early 1970s Soviet Union became the only major industrialized nation that experienced a decline in life expectancy at that time (it fell to around 63-64 years in 1982), with an increase in the gap between males and females (an average male was expected to live around 10-12 years less than an average female at the time).
starting in the 1960's, the USSR's healthcare started to fall apart: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10282748> <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jack_Salmon/publication/13015404_Anomalies_in_Soviet_healthcare/links/55c95b6e08aeb97567478155.pdf> In barely 20 years since World War II, the USSR matched 60 years of US and European health progress; however, dramatic and unusual reversals have emerged since the mid-1960s. Feshbach estimates that the crude death rate per 1000 rose 50% from 6.9 in 1964 to 10.3 in 1980. There has been a remarkable achievement in infant mortality reduction from 1950 to 1971, but the rate has apparently increased embarassing levels.

even the Kiev Court of Appeals, which finds that the USSR conducted genocide, only asserts that 3.941 million Ukranians directly died from famine: <https://lb.ua/news/2010/01/14/19793_nalivaychenko_nazval_kolichestvo_zh.html> <https://mfa.gov.ua/mediafiles/files/misc/2017-11-01/legal03a.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/637541761111031808/unknown.png 3.941 million

The evidence of these registration figures inclines me to revise my position and to suggest that the scale of mortality from the 1932/33 famine may have been somewhat larger than I had earlier suggested and might be as high as 4 to 5 million. These figures are much lower than many of the excess mortality and population loss figures that are cited in the West. Mace believes that 5-7 million for the Ukraine alone is a 'conservative figure',23 Conquest claims 5 million Ukrainian famine deaths, and 8 million overall including the North Caucasus and Kaza- khstan; but on top of this he wishes to add another 6.5 million deaths 'as a result of dekulakization'.24 The figures given by Mace and Conquest are impossible to accept.

# consensus
Robert Conquest, 2007: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Conquest> Holodomor was man-made, partially intentional, and not genocidal: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668130600652217> <https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iakh/HIS2319/h16/pensumliste/stalin-and-the-soviet-famine-of-1932-33_-a-reply-to-ellman.pdf> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/09668130600652217> Stalin purposely inflicted the 1933 famine? No. What I argue is that with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put "Soviet interest" other than feeding the starving first thus consciously abetting it.
Yaroslav Bilinsky, 2007: Holodomor was man-made, intentional, and genocidal: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623529908413948> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/14623529908413948> My argument, however, is that both logic and political usage in Ukraine point in one direction, that of the terror-famine being genocidal. Stalin hated the Ukrainians, as accepted as a fact by Sakharov, revealed in the telegram to Zatonsky and inferred from his polemics with the Yugoslav communist Semich. Stalin decided to collectivize Soviet agriculture and under the cover of collectivization teach the Ukrainians a bloody lesson. Had it not been for Stalinist hubris and the incorporation of the more nationalistically minded and less physically decimated Western Ukrainians after 1939, the Ukrainian nation might have never recovered from the Stalinist offensive against the main army of the Ukrainian national movement, the peasants.
James Mace, 1984: Holodomor was man-made, intentional, and genocidal: <https://books.google.com/books?id=f7vaF3T5a2IC> (full text not available) For the Ukrainians the famine must be understood as the most terrible part of a consistent policy carried out against them: the destruction of their cultural and spiritual elite which began with the trial of the Union for the Liberation of Ukraine, the destruction of the official Ukrainian wing of the Communist Party, and the destruction of their social basis in the countryside. Against them the famine seems to have been designed as part of a campaign to destroy them as a political factor and as a social organism.
Mark Tauger, 2006: Holodomor was partially man-made, not intentional, and not genocidal: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668130600831282> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/09668130600831282> In my 1991 article I presented these data and showed, using comparisons with official figures, a weighted average yield calculation, and other calculations, that proved that the 1932 harvest was much smaller than the official published estimate of that year, and also smaller than the harvest of 1933. This conclusion seriously undermined previous claims, for example by Robert Conquest and the late James Mace, that the famine was ‘man-made’ because the harvest was not exceptionally small and therefore did not create a shortage that would have caused the famine.
Stephen Wheatcroft, 2018: Holodomor was mostly man-made, not intentional, and not genocidal: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/contemporary-european-history/article/turn-away-from-economic-explanations-for-soviet-famines/78C193C97E6C5383C37763CADA970644> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/S0960777318000358> We all agreed that Stalin’s policy was brutal and ruthless and that its cover up was criminal, but we do not believe that it was done on purpose to kill people and cannot therefore be described as murder or genocide. [....] Davies and I have (2004) produced the most detailed account of the grain crisis in these years, showing the uncertainties in the data and the mistakes carried out by a generally ill-informed, and excessively ambitious, government. The state showed no signs of a conscious attempt to kill lots of Ukrainians and belated attempts that sought to provide relief when it eventually saw the tragedy unfolding were evident. [....] Discussions in the popular narrative of famine have changed over the years. During Soviet times there was a contrast between ‘man-made’ famine and ‘denial of famine’. ‘Man-made’ at this time largely meant as a result of policy. Then there was a contrast between ‘man-made on purpose’, and ‘man-made by accident’ with charges of criminal neglect and cover up. This stage seemed to have ended in 2004 when Robert Conquest agreed that the famine was not man-made on purpose. But in the following ten years there has been a revival of the ‘man-made on purpose’ side. This reflects both a reduced interest in understanding the economic history, and increased attempts by the Ukrainian government to classify the ‘famine as a genocide’. It is time to return to paying more attention to economic explanations.
Robert Davies, 2016: Holodomor was mostly man-made, not intentional, and not genocidal: <https://books.google.com/books?id=4s1lCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR14> In our own work we, like V.P. Kozlov, have found no evidence that the Soviet authorities undertook a programme of genocide against Ukraine. It is also certain that the statements by Ukranian politicans and publicists about the deaths from famine in Ukraine are greatly exagerrated. A prominent Ukranian historian, Stanislas Kul'chitskii, estimated deaths from famine in Ukraine at 3-3.5 million;5 and Ukrainian demograhic in Ukraine in the whole period 1926-39 (most of them during the famine) amounted to 3.5 million.6 Nevertheless, Ukrainian organisations continue, with some success, to urge Canadian schools to teach as a fact that excess deaths were 10 million during the 1932-33 famine.7 This does not mean that Ukraine did not suffer greatly during the famine. It is certainly the case that most of the famine deaths took place in Ukraine, and that the grain collection campaign was associated with the reversal of the previous policy of Ukranisation.8
Steven Rosenfielde, 2007: Holodomor was man-made, intentional, and genocidal: <https://books.google.com/books?id=KfP3twAACAAJ> <https://b-ok.cc/book/1302178/83e2b5> There was a famine (widespread health-impairing food shortage) 1932–33 caused by two bad harvests in 1931 and 1932 attributable partly to collectivization and partly to weather (although Kondrashin and Penner contest the explanation), but it didn’t cause the killings. Grain supplies were sufficient to sustain everyone if properly distributed. People died mostly of terror-starvation (excess grain exports, seizure of edibles from the starving, state refusal to provide emergency relief, bans on outmigration, and forced deportation to food-deficit locales), not poor harvests and routine administrative bungling.
Timothy Snyder, 2010: Holodomor was man-made, intentional, and genocidal: <https://books.google.com/books?id=maEfAQAAQBAJ> <https://b-ok.cc/book/1242771/eec13d> In the waning weeks of 1932, facing no external security threat and no challenge from within, with no conceivable justification except to prove the inevitability of his rule, Stalin chose to kill millions of people in Soviet Ukraine. [....] It was not food shortages but food distribution that killed millions in Soviet Ukraine, and it was Stalin who decided who was entitled to what. [....] Though collectivization was a disaster everywhere in the Soviet Union, the evidence of clearly premeditated mass murder on the scale of millions is most evident in Soviet Ukraine. Collectivization had involved the massive use of executions and deportations everywhere in the Soviet Union, and the peasants and nomads who made up the bulk of the Gulag’s labor force hailed from all of the Soviet republics. Famine had struck parts of Soviet Russia as well as much of Soviet Ukraine in 1932. Nevertheless, the policy response to Ukraine was special, and lethal. Seven crucial policies were applied only, or mainly, in Soviet Ukraine in late 1932 or early 1933. Each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each of them had to kill.
Raphael Lemkin, 1953: Holodomor was man-made, intentional, and genocidal: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Lemkin> Holodomor was man-made and genocidal: <http://history.org.ua/LiberUA/RaphaelLemkin_1953/RaphaelLemkin_1953.pdf> What I want to speak about is perhaps the classic example of Soviet genocide, its longest and broadest experiment in Russification — the destruction of the Ukrainian nation. This is, as I have said, only the logical successor of such Tsarist crimes as the drowning of 10,000 Crimean Tatars by order of Catherine the Great, the mass murders of Ivan the Terrible's ‘SS troops’ — the Oprichnina; the extermination of National Polish leaders and Ukrainian Catholics by Nicholas I; and the series of Jewish pogroms that have stained Russian history periodically.

both weather and collectivization played a substantial role in the Holodomor: Tauger lists 13 causes for the 1933 famines: extreme drought, a sudden midwinter warm spell, heavy rains late in the growing season, rust (plant disease), smut (plant disease), ergot (plant disease), pests, mass killing of draft forces (horses) without compensatory increases in tractors, peasant exile and reduced labor, peasant opposition to collectivization, soil exhaustion, weeds, and mice: <https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89> <http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89/90> <http://web.archive.org/web/20190419011701/https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/download/89/90>
famines occurred under the NEP, before collectivization: <https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89> <http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89/90> <http://web.archive.org/web/20190419011701/https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/download/89/90> Serious droughts led to famines during the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1924 -- 1925 in European Russia and Ukraine, and in 1928-1929, which was most severe in Ukraine. In both cases, the regime acknowledged the crises and formed extraordinary agencies to manage relief.16 The 1928-1929 Ukrainian famine, which has not been recognized in the Western literature but is documented in Ukrainian sources, was a major cause of the "grain crisis" because it substantially reduced grain supplies for the urban population as well as for peasants in the drought regions. The grain crisis and famine of 1928-1929 were among the main factors that led Soviet leaders and officials to resort to the "extraordinary measures" to procure food from peasants in other regions, to import food from abroad, to ration food in towns and in rural famine districts, and ultimately to undertake the collectivization of agriculture.17 Even in 1930 many regions had unfavorable weather and crop failures: in parts of the North Caucasus, crop failures forced local authorities to appeal to central authorities for seed aid, which they received, and crop failures also reduced harvests in Kazakstan and the Middle Volga.18

# exports
the USSR curtailed exports, urban rations, and rural rations (Tauger 1991): <https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C5FC508259E11A70BFBFA5AE5A2C4E9F/S0037677900000863a.pdf/1932_harvest_and_the_famine_of_1933.pdf> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.2307/2500600> The low 1932 harvest meant that the regime did not have sufficient grain for urban and rural food supplies, seed, and exports. The authorities curtailed all of these, but ultimately rural food supplies had last priority. The harsh 1932-1933 procurements only displaced the famine from urban areas, which would have suffered a similar scale of mortality without the grain the procurements provided (though, as noted above, urban mortality rates also rose in 1933). **The severity and geographical extent of the famine, the sharp decline in exports in 1932-1933, seed requirements, and the chaos in the Soviet Union in these years, all lead to the conclusion that even a complete cessation of exports would not have been enough to prevent famine. This situation makes it difficult to accept the interpretation of the famine as the result of the 1932 grain procurements and as a conscious act of genocide. The harvest of 1932 essentially made a famine inevitable. Although the low 1932 harvest may have been a mitigating circumstance, the regime was still responsible for the deprivation and suffering of the Soviet population in the early 1930s.** The data presented here provide a more precise measure of the consequences of collectivization and forced industrialization than has previously been available; if anything, these data show that the effects of those policies were worse than has been assumed. They also, however, indicate that the famine was real, the result of a failure of economic policy, of the "revolution from above," rather than of a "successful" nationality policy against Ukrainians or other ethnic groups.
the USSR substantially curtailed exports -- 1932 exports were 34% of 1931, first half of 1933 exports were 4% (Tauger 2001): <https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89> <http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89/90> <http://web.archive.org/web/20190419011701/https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/download/89/90> The amount of grain exported during the peak of the famine in the first half of 1933, however, approximately 220,000 tons, was small, less than 1 percent of the lowest harvest estimates, and the regime was using virtually all the rest of the available harvest to feed people. The actual amounts of grain needed and utilized for this purpose can only be approximated. [....] As can be seen from comparing these statistics with the data on procurements in tables 1 and 2, the total of supply and exports nearly exhausts the total grain available from procurements in these years. The Soviet government did have small reserves of grain, but continually drew these down to allocate food to the population.5 Since virtually the entire country experienced shortages of food, indicating that the procurement and distribution data are reasonably accurate, clearly the Soviet Union faced a severe shortage, and the most important cause of that shortage has to have been small harvests in 1931 and 1932. [....] Internationally, Soviet leaders faced a military threat in the Far East that had resulted from the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, an extremely tense situation in Germany as the Nazi party rose to power, distrustful relations with Poland, and a serious balance of payments deficit that put the Soviet Union under intense pressure to export commodities and to curtail imports of producer goods, both desperately needed internally.

<https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89> <http://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/view/89/90> <http://web.archive.org/web/20190419011701/https://carlbeckpapers.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/cbp/article/download/89/90> During those same periods [July 1931 to June 1932] the regime drastically curtailed grain exports, from 4.7 million tons to 1.6 million tons.

# ethnicities affected
Stanislav Kulchytsky and Hennadiy Yefimenko state that the statistical distribution of famine's victims among the ethnicities closely reflects the ethnic distribution of the rural population of Ukraine. The more-rural Moldavian, Polish, German, and Bulgarian populations of Ukraine suffered in the same proportion as the rural Ukrainian population, while the more-urban Russians and Jews survived the famine more successfully: <http://web.archive.org/web/20191031134756/http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?C21COM=2&I21DBN=ELIB&P21DBN=ELIB&Image_file_name=book/0002027.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641685664634765334/unknown.png Статистика смертності в національному розрізі за 1933 р. виглядає таким чином: Аналізуючи цю таблицю, слід пам'ятати, що в ній подається як природна смертність, так і смертність від толоду. Спрямований проти українського села терор голодом захопив усіх, хто проживав у ньому. У формах звітності за національною ознакою була зареєстрована більша кількість смертей, ніж у формах природного руху (1850,3 тис. чоловік). Частка українців серед загиблих приблизно відповідає їх питомій вазі у сільському населенні республіки. Молдавське, польське, німецьке і болгарське населення майже повністю проживало в селах. Тому воно постраждало від голоду в таких же пропорціях, як українці. Євреї мешкали більшою частиною у містах. Тому смертність серед них мало відрізнялася від нормальної. Переважна більшість росіян теж проживала в містах. Серед порівняно нечисленного населення в російських селах зареєстрована основна частина померлих. Треба прийняти до уваги, що облік смертності в містах майже не зазнав деформацій і тому був відносно повним. Навпаки, в селах органи ЗАГС спромоглися зареєструвати менше половини смертних випадків. Все це вказує на те, що терор голодом цілив своїм вістрям не в етнічних українців, а в сільське населення.

# irish potato famine
the irish potato famine occurred during a period of lassiez-faire UK domestic and trade policy: <https://whistlinginthewind.org/2012/08/25/laissez-faire-and-the-irish-great-famine/>
ireland was a net exporter during the famine: <http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf> One of the most remarkable facts about the famine period is that there was an average monthly export of food from Ireland worth 100,000 Pound Sterling. Almost throughout the five-year famine, Ireland remained a net exporter of food. (31.) Dr. Christine Kinealy, a fellow at the University of Liverpool and the author of two scholarly texts on the Irish Famine: This Great Calamity and A Death-Dealing Famine, says that 9,992 calves were exported from Ireland to England during "Black'47", an increase of thirty-three percent from the previous year. In the twelve months following the second failure of the potato crop, 4,000 horses and ponies were exported. The export of livestock to Britain (with the exception of pigs) increased during the "famine". The export of bacon and ham increased. In total, over three million live animals were exported from Ireland between 1846-50, more than the number of people who emigrated during the famine years.
ireland had previously banned exports during the 82-83 famine: <http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/irish.pdf> When Ireland experienced an earlier famine in 1782-83, ports were closed in order to keep home grown food for domestic consumption. Food prices were immediately reduced within Ireland. The merchants lobbied against such efforts, but their protests were over-ridden. Everyone recognized that the interests of the merchants and the distressed people were irreconcilable. In the Great Famine, that recognition was disregarded.
the "English blockade" and "three Turkish ships" are both memes: <https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5jcffu/was_englands_role_in_worsening_the_potato_famine/> <https://mikedashhistory.com/2014/12/29/queen-victorias-5-the-strange-tale-of-turkish-aid-to-ireland-during-the-great-famine/> According to the researches of Brendan Matthews, one of these ships was probably Prussian: she was named the Meta, and her home port was Stettin, on the Baltic Sea. The other two, however, came from the Balkans, which were then still under Ottoman control. They were the Porcupine and the Ann – two rather English names for ships – and they apparently had English masters, for their names were Cleveland and Cloid (Floyd?) Nonetheless, they had sailed from Ottoman Selânik (today Thessaloniki, in modern Greece). All three merchantmen carried cargoes of wheat and “Indian corn” – cheap maize, one of Ireland’s principal imports during the famine years. This is a remarkable find – more so given the rarity of foreign commerce in small Irish ports in those days – but it is only fair to point out that the newspapers contain a strong indication that the cargoes of the Porcupine and the Ann were trade goods, not charity; they were consigned to local merchants based in Louth and Meath, who it might be expected would sell them rather than give them away. Speculation in imported corn, moreover, was scarcely unheard-of two years into the Great Famine; the Ottomans grew it, and the owners of the Porcupine and the Ann presumably knew that they did.

# molotov-ribbentrop pact

the USSR had signed a mutual defense treaty with France; instead, in 1938, France supported the Munich agreement: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Soviet_Treaty_of_Mutual_Assistance> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia%E2%80%93Soviet_Union_relations> <http://www.forost.ungarisches-institut.de/pdf/19350516-1.pdf> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement>
between April and August 1939, the USSR attempted to establish tripartite mutual defense treaty with Britain and France. Suspicion of socialism and belief that war could be avoided prevented the West from taking the talks seriously; in addition, Poland refused to allow Soviet troops through its territory. After a long failure of the talks, the USSR pursued a non-aggresion treaty with Germany: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish_military_alliance#Franco-British_failed_alliance_with_Moscow> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09668139308412091> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713663077>

# world war 1
World War 1 (1914-1918) killed 1.3% of the population (2.25 million <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_I)> of 170.1 million Empire residents <http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/russia/eurrusdemhist17961917.html>)

# civil war
the 1917 Russian Civil War (1917-1921) killed 4.1-7.1% of the population (7-12 million <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War> of 170.1 million)

# world war 2
World War 2 (1941-1945) killed 15.6% of the population (26.6 million <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties_of_the_Soviet_Union> of 170 million <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Census_(1937)>) and eliminated 25% of the national wealth (<https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/great-patriotic-war/pdf/economy.pdf>).
World War II destruction: <https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/great-patriotic-war/pdf/economy.pdf> 31850 factories, 102766 farms, 216700 stores, 6000 hospitals, 83520 schools, 334 universities, 43000 libraries, 1.2 million urban dwellings (about 1/3), 65000 kilometers of railroad (about 1/3), 15800 locomotives, 428000 railcars, 137000 tractors [....] The total property losses on the occupied territories of the U .S.S.R., i.e., the losses inflicted on fixed and circulating capital funds, or the direct damage done to the state and the population by the destruction and plunder of state, cooperative, and personal property during the war, amount in pre-war state prices to 679 billion rubles, or 128 billion American dollars. These property losses amount to about two-thirds of the pre-war national wealth of the territories of the U.S.S.R. that underwent occupation.
Comparisons: USA 2019, 6210 hospitals <https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals> USA 2014-15: 98176 schools and 7151 universities <https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=84> USA 2017-18: 116867 libraries <https://libguides.ala.org/numberoflibraries>
reparations were worthless: <https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/great-patriotic-war/pdf/economy.pdf> The material damage inflicted on the peoples of the U.S.S.R. by Hitler's Germany is compensated only in insignificant measure by the transfer of industrial equipment from Germany to the U.S.S.R. as reparations. The value of this equipment amounts in all to only 0.6 per cent of the above-mentioned direct property losses alone suffered by the U.S.S.R. during the Patriotic War.
lend-lease was significant but not that significant: <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/totalwar2005.pdf> The pressure on resources was somewhat alleviated by foreign aid, which added approximately 5 per cent to Soviet resources in 1942 and 10 per cent in 1943 and 1944.
lend-lease was less important to the Soviet war economy than importation of industry from European conquests by Germany: <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/ehr88postprint.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561488053055520770/unknown.png

east germany grew as quickly as west germany did (p.53): <https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/28587/ssoar-hsrsupp-2009-no_21-heske-volkswirtschaftliche_gesamtrechnung_ddr_1950-1989.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640208079396274197/unknown.png

reparations were extremely expensive: <http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-5098.html> The reorientation and restructuring of the East German economy would have been difficult in any case. The substantial reparations costs that the Soviet Union imposed on its occupation zone, and later on East Germany, made the process even more difficult. Payments continued into the early 1950s, ending only with the death of Stalin. According to Western estimates, these payments amounted to about 25 percent of total East German production through 1953.

# consensus
scientific consensus in genetics opposes racialism: <http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/science-genetics-reshaping-race-debate-21st-century/> <https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(18)30363-X> Genetics demonstrates that humans cannot be divided into biologically distinct subcategories. Although there are clear observable correlations between variation in the human genome and how individuals identify by race, the study of human genetics challenges the traditional concept of different races of humans as biologically separate and distinct. This is validated by many decades of research, including recent examples. Most human genetic variation is distributed as a gradient, so distinct boundaries between population groups cannot be accurately assigned. There is considerable genetic overlap among members of different populations. Such patterns of genome variation are explained by patterns of migration and mixing of different populations throughout human history. In this way, genetics exposes the concept of “racial purity” as scientifically meaningless.
scientific consensus in anthropology opposes racialism: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajpa.23120> Table 2 (middle column) provides a summary of the reported levels of agreement and disagreement with statements on race. Only six of the 53 statements reflect undecided perspectives or lack of general consensus among professional anthropologists (including, e.g., whether race influences health and whether genetic ancestry testing undermines biological conceptions of race). **Fourteen statements evoked unified responses from a super-majority, with professional anthropologists (a) rejecting the idea that humans can be subdivided into biological races; [rejecting] the idea that races are biologically determined; [rejecting] the existence of discrete boundaries among races;** and [rejecting] the use of genetic ancestry when making child placement or college admission decisions and (b) accepting the existence of biological variation; overlapping trait distributions; **[accepting] the superiority of genetic ancestry over race as a proxy for genetic relationships between peoples;** [accepting] the importance of understanding the relationship among race, genetics and health; and [accepting] the need to take genetic ancestry into account when diagnosing and treating certain conditions. Informal analysis of the data did not reveal any noticeable differences in perspectives between subfields.
in physical anthropology, racialism has been dying since the 1900s: of race articles in 1920's 70% supported racialism; in 1990 just 15% did: <https://repozytorium.amu.edu.pl/bitstream/10593/4333/1/01lieb.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/541319247725330458/unknown.png

# censorship
it is not taboo to study race: <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/racial-differences-in-addiction-and-other-disorders-arent-mostly-genetic/> In the most recent NIH Biennial Report to Congress, for example, the words “genomic,” “genome,” and “genetic” are used a total of 556 times. In comparison, other words such as “social determinants of health,” “discrimination,” “poverty,” “socioeconomic status,” “racism,” and “sexism” appeared a total of 15 times in the entirety of the report’s 441 pages. In the decade between 1994 and 2005, the NIH funded 22,000 studies investigating genomics, 1,300 of which discussed race, genes and disease. The number of grants awarded to research the connection between health, racism and racial discrimination? Only 44.

# variation: mostly shared
the vast majority (90%) of human genetic variation occurs within, not between, populations: <http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5866/1100.full> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/450500884217200661/F3.large.jpg We carried out an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (18, 19) to partition overall genetic variation into three components: within-population (WP), among-population-within-group (i.e., geographical region) (AP/WG), and among geographical region (AG). **The 51 populations are assigned to the seven geographical regions shown in Fig. 1A. The results are similar among autosomal chromosomes: the WP, AP/WG, and AG components explain 88.9 ± 0.3%, 2.1 ± 0.05%, and 9.0 ± 0.3% (mean ± SD across 22 chromosomes) of the variance, respectively (Fig. 3A).**
the vast majority (86%) of SNPs in the average human's genome are common among all humans ("cosmopolitan"): 84.7 million SNPs, 3.6 million short indels, 60k structural variants (>99% of SNPs with frequency >1%): <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15393> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/418850379518705675/511289755938455563/unknown.png Although most common variants are shared across the world, rarer variants are typically restricted to closely related populations (Fig. 1a); 86% of variants were restricted to a single continental group. [....] The majority of variants in the data set are rare: ∼64 million autosomal variants have a frequency <0.5%, ∼12 million have a frequency between 0.5% and 5%, and only ∼8 million have a frequency >5% (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, the majority of variants observed in a single genome are common: just 40,000 to 200,000 of the variants in a typical genome (1–4%) have a frequency <0.5% (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3b).
This should not come as a surprise; more than 80% of human SNP alleles are cosmopolitan: <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06742> <https://www.sci-hub.se/10.1038/nature06742>

# variation: mostly by distance
human variation is highly clinal (it fits isolation by distance, IBD) rather than racial; geographic distance along landmasses explains 76% of genetic distance between individuals: <http://golem.anth.wsu.edu/sites/ipem.anth.wsu.edu/files/Handley_etal_2007-TIG.pdf> <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05562> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/450503128886935552/unknown.png
human variation is highly clinal (it fits isolation by distance, IBD) rather than racial: <https://genome.cshlp.org/content/14/9/1679.full> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641982438238715904/F3.png In the light of these results, and in agreement with extensive studies of classical genetic markers (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994), it seems that gradual variation and isolation by distance rather than major genetic discontinuities is typical of global human genetic diversity. Obviously, this does not imply that genetic discontinuities do not exist on a more local scale, for example, between people from different linguistic groups (e.g., Barbujani and Sokal 1990; Sokal et al. 1990). It also does not mean that no differences whatsoever exist between continental groups. In fact, what Rosenberg et al. (2002) have shown is that given enough markers and the extraordinary power of Structure, the tiny amounts of genetic differences that exist between continents can also be discerned. However, this should not obscure the fact that on a worldwide scale, clines are a better representation of the human diversity than clades, and that continents do not represent more substantial discontinuities in such clines than many other geographical and cultural barriers.

# variation: fst
2010 review: humans have a low F_st value: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952510000788> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/541320761307168768/unknown.png More recent work suggests that the human species’ FST could actually be lower, between 0.05 and 0.13 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 for autosomal SNPs (Table 1), in other words between one-third and one-half of that observed in gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; FST = 0.38 [28]) and between Western and Eastern chimpanzee (FST = 0.32 [15]) despite humans occupying a much broader geographic area [29]. In short, not only do humans show the lowest species diversity among primates [30] but are also subdivided into populations that are more closely related than any other primate species, with the possible exception of bonobos (Pan paniscus) [18]. [....] The limited degree of differentiation among human populations does not suggest a history of long-term isolation and differentiation, but rather that genome variation was mostly shaped by our comparatively recent origin from a small number of founders 32, 33 who dispersed to colonize the whole planet 34, 35.
isolation by distance explains most human variation: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4756148/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564359627832033311/unknown.png [T]he emerging scientific consensus is that while isolation by distance explained a large proportion of human population pair-wise Fst-values, cluster, the computational placeholder for race, explained <2% (Rosenberg et al., 2005; Handley et al., 2007). Thus, the indistinctiveness Fst-value argument, as construed here against the idea of biological reality of human races, is not simply about crude Fst measures. It also takes into consideration the part of Fst quantitatively explained by cluster/race (Table ​(Table2).2). So it goes beyond Wright's qualitative guideline about the use of Fst. The argument thus has two quantitative components, the unadjusted Fst-values and the adjusted values of cluster/race covariate. It can thus be considered the quantitative equivalent of the qualitative argument of “lack of distinction” Darwin used to question the taxonomic wisdom of categorizing humans into races in natural classification since the categories cannot be objectively defined (Maglo, 2011).

# identification: importance
it is not necessarily true that, because we can identify it, something is biologically important. ("because we can identify self-reported race with genes, race is biologically important".) for example, Leslie 2015 divided Britain into >10 different genetic groups based on recent (<1000yr) migrations, but different British populations do not seem meaningfully different: <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14230> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/564361049546162176/nature14230-f1.png

# identification: validity
obviously, identification for a small set of SNPs that we associate with self-identified race has high predictive power. however, for large sets of SNPs, identification becomes very difficult. given that most genetic traits (such as height and intelligence) are highly polygenic, this strongly reduces the effectiveness of race as an identifier: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/541327044839997451/GEN1761351f2.png Thus the answer to the question “How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?” depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity and the populations being compared. The answer, ω can be read from Figure 2. Given 10 loci, three distinct populations, and the full spectrum of polymorphisms (Figure 2E), the answer is ω=0.3, or nearly one-third of the time. With 100 loci, the answer is ~20% of the time and even using 1000 loci, ω=10%. However, if genetic similarity is measured over many thousands of loci, the answer becomes “never” when individuals are sampled from geographically separated populations. On the other hand, if the entire world population were analyzed, the inclusion of many closely related and admixed populations would increase ω. This is illustrated by the fact that ω and the classification error rates, CC and CT, all remain greater than zero when such populations are analyzed, despite the use of >10,000 polymorphisms (Table 1, microarray data set; Figure 2D).
linguistic-genomic data demonstrates race as invalid: <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01837-7> Our findings indicate that ancestry cross-classifies ethno-linguistic group as well as continent and race. To expound this point, Western Asian ancestry currently exists at its highest frequency in peoples from the Caucasus Mountains and the Levant and is the major ancestry in Abkhazian, Georgian, and Druze samples. Yet, significant amounts of Western Asian ancestry are present in samples with origins ranging from Morocco to Mongolia and from England to Ethiopia. That is, Western Asian ancestry simultaneously exists in Africa, Asia, and Europe, as well as in the US racial categories Black or African American, Asian, and White. Thus, in contrast to race, ancestry is a valid genomic classifier.

# identification: Tang
Tang and Risch's 2005 study (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1196372/>) is based on a flawed methodology. This was discussed in short in Maglo et. al. 2016 (<https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2016.00022/full> "Curiously, [Tang 2005] perform[s] cluster analysis on admixed populations by bypassing [the correlated allele model]") and in long by Graves 2011: http://www.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7312/columbia/9780231156974.001.0001/upso-9780231156974-chapter-8: However there are apparent problems in the way this analysis was run. **The authors admit that they did not engage the admixture option in Structure. Given that two of the populations in question, US blacks and Mexican Americans are known to be admixed, this is a major error.** Furthermore, the authors could have easily run the data set again with the admixture option enabled. This would have allowed them to compare the two treatments to determine if this second analysis gave significantly different results from the first. In the case of African Americans there is excellent indication that an admixture analysis would have shown quite different results. **Another study using a much larger number of genetic markers (a full genome scan of about 250,000 SNPs) indicated that African American admixture ranged from as high as 99 percent to as low as 1 percent with a median value of 18%.** Despite this apparent fault in the study procedure the authors were still confident that their analysis supported the notion that self-identified race corresponded to an underlying biological race structure within the human species. **The largest misconception of this approach is that it ignores the fact that isolation by distance explains the vast majority of variation in human allele frequencies. Thus, 75 percent of human allele frequency variation is explained by geographic distance. This means that it is possible to produce the appearance of clustering simply by where one samples genetic variation.** Serre and Paabo demonstrated that heterogeneous sampling gave rise to genetic clusters that were biologically meaningless. This is precisely what is occurring in biomedical research in the United States.

Data were collated for latitude, prevalence of harmful parasites, mean annual temperature, and variation in annual temperature for the location of 175 hominid crania dating from 1.9 million to 10 thousand years ago. We also included a proxy for population density and two indexes of paleoclimatic variability for the time at which each cranium was discovered. Results revealed independent contributions of population density, variation in paleoclimate, and temperature variation to the prediction of change in hominid cranial capacity (CC). **Although the effects of paleoclimatic variability and temperature variation provide support for climatic hypotheses, the proxy for population density predicted more unique variance in CC than all other variables. The pattern suggests multiple pressures drove hominid brain evolution and that the core selective force was social competition.** [....] The third panel shows a similar relationship between temperature variation and CC; as temperature variation increases to the mean of this variable, CC increases. However, at approximately 0.5 SD from the mean or higher, increases in temperature variation are associated with decreases in CC. The amplitude of this function is less than 200 cm3.

The lost adoptees had relatively low IQs, so the remaining White adoptees were unrepresentatively high in IQ[.] [....] One can prove this by comparing the original IQs of the full sample and the subgroup who were measured at both ages 7 and 17; the latter subgroup had an initial mean IQ of 117.6 (with a minimum IQ of 92) but the full sample had an initial mean of 111.5 (minimum 62).``````Meanwhile, the BW and Black–Black adoptees lost to follow-up hardly differed in IQ from the remaining adoptees, so attrition inflated those groups’ mean IQs by about only 0.2 and −0.7 points respectively.``````Hence, allowing for attrition, the IQ differences between the White and the Black adoptees were no larger at age 17 than at age 7, a sign that the apparent enlarging was an artifact and not a genetic effect. With the widening explained, the only racial IQ differences left to comment on are those present at initial testing.```
in the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study (MTRAS), black-black childrens' adoptive families were worse in every environmental variable measured: <https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/5/1/1> Only the IQ of the Black–Black adoptees, who scored 12.2 ± 2.8 points below the BW adoptees, calls for a specific explanation. Differences in home environment are one possibility. On every reported environmental variable, the Black–Black adoptees were worse off than both the BW and fully White adoptees, which I quantify by comparing the former against the BW adoptees, measuring the environmental differences in BW SDs. I use the BW adoptees as a comparison group here because Scarr and Weinberg [13] present more data for BW adoptees than White adoptees. The Black–Black adoptees were older when adopted (by 2.1 SDs, or two years); had spent less time in their adoptive home (by 1.1 SDs); had more (by 0.4 SDs) and lower-quality (by 0.8 SDs) adoptive placements; and had adoptive parents with less education and lower mean IQ (by 0.2–0.3 SDs). Additionally, 97% of the BW adoptees had White mothers while the Black–Black adoptees all had Black mothers, with whatever prenatal environmental differences that entailed.
the results of the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study (MTRAS) were not replicated in other contemporary studies; in Tizard 1974 black-white children had (insignificantly) higher IQ means than white-white children; in Moore 1986 black-black children had (insignificantly) higher IQ means than black-white children: <https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/5/1/1> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640730404923506708/unknown.png

scientific consensus among 75 experts supports the Flynn Effect: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886916310984> Experts expected 21st century IQ increases in currently on average low-ability regions (+ 6 to + 7 IQ points, in Latin America, Africa, India) and in East Asia (+ 7 IQ), but not in the West (a stagnation, below + 1 IQ), with a small decline in the US (− 0.45 IQ). Similar results were obtained for all experts and experts on the Flynn effect itself (mean r = 0.90 to 0.97; N = 17). The results correlated strongly with and confirmed a recent meta-analysis on the causes of the Flynn effect (r = 0.65 to 0.71; Pietschnig & Voracek, 2015).

metastudy: the flynn effect has declined but not reversed (slower growth but still growth): <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691615577701> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1177/1745691615577701> However, the pattern preceding this period appears to be considerably more differentiated, indicating that gains during the early 20th century have been relatively weak (0.80 IQ points per decade), then showed a sharp increase in the 1920s (7.20 IQ points per decade), decreased again from 1935 to 1947 (2.10 IQ points per decade), but later again recovered until 1976 (3.00 IQ points per decade; Table S3).
metastudy: no decline: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152423/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/a0037173> However, although we cannot directly address cohort effects in this meta-analysis, we note that the magnitude of increases in Wechsler and SB scores has remained close to the nominal value of 3 IQ points per decade since 1984 (Flynn, 2009a).

the reverse Flynn effect occurs *within* families as well, suggesting genetics (eg, dysgenic effects, immigration) cannot be the primary cause: <https://www.pnas.org/content/115/26/6674> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/588298431785730068/F2.png The results show that large positive and negative trends in cohort IQ operate within as well as across families. This implies that the trends are not due to a changing composition of families, and that there is at most a minor role for explanations involving genes (e.g., immigration and dysgenic fertility) and environmental factors largely fixed within families (e.g., parental education, socialization effects of low-ability parents, and family size). While such factors may be present, their influence is negligible compared with other environmental factors. Notably, this goes counter to the conclusion of a recent review on retrograde Flynn effects (6) and the expert opinions reported in a recent survey of intelligence researchers, which found “the anti-Flynn effect being attributed mainly to genetics and immigration” (7). As noted by two of the reviewers, the magnitude of the negative Flynn trend in our data itself speaks against the dysgenic hypothesis for retrograde Flynn effects, as changes in IQ over time are too large to plausibly reflect selection-driven genetic change in the population. [....] Polygenic scores that predict education are correlated with IQ and have been shown to correlate negatively with fertility in Icelandic and US data (16, 17). The authors of the Icelandic study extrapolate that their results imply a decline of 0.30 IQ point per decade, an effect sufficiently small to fall within the uncertainty bounds of the difference between across- and within-family trend estimates in the present study.

# self: aggression: testosterone
in a sample of 1881 bostonians, blacks and whites and Hispanics didn't differ in testosterone: <https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/91/11/4326/2656429> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542051741018095636/zeg0110646170001.png With or without adjustment for covariates, there were no significant differences in testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, or SHBG levels by race/ethnicity. DHEAS levels differed by race/ethnicity before covariate adjustment; after adjustment this difference was attenuated. Before adjustment, DHT and DHT to testosterone ratios did not significantly differ by racial/ethnic group. After adjustment, there was evidence of racial/ethnic differences in DHT (P = 0.047) and DHT to testosterone (P = 0.038) levels. Black men had higher DHT levels and DHT to testosterone ratios than white and Hispanic men.
in a sample of 280, race did not affect testosterone or risk-taking: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453015002024> Because of our predominantly Caucasian samples, any effects of racial differences in testosterone would have to be extremely large to systematically influence our results. Nevertheless, we did examine if differences between Caucasians and non-Caucasians existed for cortisol, testosterone, and our risk-taking measures in each study, but none were found (ps ≥ .380). Furthermore, controlling for whether participants were Caucasian did not alter the significance of our reported Testosterone × Cortisol interactions (ps ≤ .040), and moderated regression analysis testing 3-way Race × Testosterone × Cortisol interactions revealed that Caucasian status did not moderate our reported dual-hormone interactions (ps ≥ .307).

However, black men had the highest estradiol level overall across all ages, which was not explained by racial differences in the prevalence of factors that influence hormone levels. Mexican-American men had hormonal profiles similar to non-Hispanic white men, with the exception of higher testosterone.

poverty, uneducation, poor social networks, and high toxicity factors (eg, lead exposure) explain 60% of the black-white gap in teen crime rates and about 1/6th of the variation of black teen crime rates in Chicago: <https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2019/03/27/1820464116.full.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/568911929318440987/unknown.png This difference in exposure is large enough to plausibly account for a substantial portion of racial disparities in intergenerational inequality. According to our model, for example, if the poor black boys in our sample had been exposed to the toxicity levels experienced by their white peers, their predicted likelihood of incarceration after controlling for parent income would have been 5.8 percentage points lower, or almost 60% of the gap between blacks and whites in our sample.

# environment: lead
the difference between atmospheric lead between the least-enleadened and most-enleadened US county predicted 4x higher homicide rates: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/190628> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1001/archpedi.155.5.579> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640930782440849430/unknown.png Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationship between air lead concentrations and the incidence of homicide across counties in the United States (N = 3111). After adjusting for sociologic confounding factors and 9 measures of air pollution, the only indictor of air pollution found to be associated with homicide rates was air lead concentration. Across all counties, estimated air lead concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.17 µg/m3. The adjusted results suggest that the difference between the highest and lowest level of estimated air lead is associated with a homicide incidence rate ratio of 4.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.61).
suburban air lead strongly predicted assault rates in Australia: <https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-016-0122-3> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1186/s12940-016-0122-3> Accounting for socio-demographic covariates, lead in air remained a strong predictor of assault rates. For every additional μg/m3 of lead in air, assault rates 21 years later increased by 163 per 100,000 population (see Table 3). Lead in air was the strongest predictor in the model, accounting for 29.8 % of the variance in assault rates 21 years later. By comparison, the proportion of the population aged 15–24 accounted for 5.4 % of the variance, and the proportion of the population who completed secondary school accounted for 5.0 %.

We find that there is substantial excess heterogeneity in the empirical distribution of the racial gap in the incarceration rate. The quantitative impact of this gap on sentencing disparity is of considerable magnitude. If a defendant assigned to a 10th-percentile judge was instead sentenced by a 90th-percentile judge, the racial gap in the incarceration rate would rise by a full 18 percentage points.

# genetic testing superior
genetic testing is far superior to ethnicity for providing personalized medicine: <https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/clpt.2008.114> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641983496683782184/cptclpt2008114-fig-0001-m.png Given these trends, race/ethnicity should be considered only a makeshift solution for personalized genomics because it is too approximate; known differences may occur within a defined category. One example of such variability is provided by CYP2D6, which is involved in metabolizing codeine, antipsychotics, and antidepressants. The CYP2D6*17 form has moderately lower enzymatic activity than the wild type. However, different populations within Africa can have different frequencies for a variant. The *17 allele in CYP2D6 is found in 9%, 17%, and 34% of the Ethiopian, Tanzanian, and Zimbabwean populations, respectively. Clearly, lumping together all of Africa obscures the differences between the populations. The label “African” or “African-American” is therefore insufficient to determine whether an individual comes from a population with a high frequency of the *17 allele. Even if an individual is known to be, for example, Ethiopian rather than Zimbabwean, the ancestry is less relevant than the true genotype, which could be easily resolved with today's technology.
race is not the best explanation for differences in diabetes: it's urbanization and resulting diet: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-4446.12118> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1111/1468-4446.12118> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640932950447226880/bjos12118-fig-5001.png To return to the extraordinarily high rate of diabetes among the Pima, an alternative to the genetic approach sets the analytic frame in a broader sociohistorical context. Those who approach the matter from this angle have a very different view of how to think about diabetes prevention and treatment. In the graphic below on ‘prevalence of diabetes in related populations’ note the striking pattern of urban versus rural dwelling among six populations across the globe. Those who live in urban areas and consume a westernized diet have a very high rate of diabetes, but those who have lived in ‘traditional’ sites where they practice ‘traditional culture’ hardly experience any diabetes.

# cystic fibrosis
racial medicine results in underdiagnosis of cycstic fibrosis among nonwhites: <https://www.nature.com/articles/gim2015157> The highest reported prevalence of CF is among individuals of Caucasian descent,7 in whom it is the leading cause of death among autosomal recessive diseases.7,8 It was assumed that CF only affected Caucasians, which skewed research efforts. [....] Several factors prevent the identification of CF patients on the African continent within the critical 6-week window. First, the assumption among clinicians that CF predominantly affects Caucasians has not been completely dispelled, resulting in underdiagnosis among non-Caucasians.

# bidil
there's no evidence that bidil is more effective among african-americans -- it was only tested in african-americans: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002716215591476: In 2001 NitroMed, a small pharmaceutical company focused on bringing BiDil to market and began a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate BiDil’s race specificity. They enrolled approximately one thousand people who “self-identified as black (defined as of African descent)” and hoped to demonstrate that BiDil was more effective than the placebo. In summer 2004, researchers halted the study prematurely; analysis of the initial data revealed a 43 percent decreased mortality rate among patients on BiDil compared to those on placebo. [....] Opponents of the race-specificity claim argued that such claims were empirically unfounded. After all, the NitroMed study did not enroll any other self-identified races (Dorr and Jones 2008). Hence, it actually had zero data on the effect of race specificity. Still, the power of biological determinism and racial essentialism held. After the FDA’s advisory council met in June 2005 to consider arguments for and against BiDil and its claims of race-specific metabolism, the FDA approved BiDil as a medication indicated for use specifically in self-identified blacks (cf. Gellene 2005).

[....] Nevertheless, as we recognised in the protocol,15 some variability in these populations remained, mostly at the extremes of gestational age in some parameters. This variation might have arisen because of residual secular trends, true inter-ethnic diff erences,10 unstable estimations due to the small sample sizes at some gestational age windows, or simply diff erences in protocol implementation despite our best eff orts to standardise rigorously across the study sites. **However, we confirmed that such variability among sites represents only 3% of the total variance for skeletal growth, whereas the variability in individuals within a site is seven times higher (table 3).** [....] These results support pooling of the data for the construction of international standards. The data are in strong agreement with those of the WHO MGRS, and suggest that **differences reported in the scientific literature in fetal growth and newborn size are more likely due to environmental and socioeconomic differences than genetic variation, as has been shown for infants and children.**

# morphology: skull shape
<http://references.260mb.com/Biometria/Relethford2002.pdf> These methods are applied to global data on craniometric variation (57 traits) and skin color. Multivariate analysis of craniometric variation shows results similar to those obtained from genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms: roughly 13% of the total diversity is among regions, 6% among local populations within regions, and 81% within local populations. This distribution is concordant with neutral genetic markers. Skin color shows the opposite pattern, with 88% of total variation among regions, 3% among local populations within regions, and 9% within local populations, a pattern shaped by natural selection.

# morphology: dick size
as of 2015, there was no evidence for race-based differences in penis size: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bju.13010> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1111/bju.13010> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/630663015615823902/unknown.png It is not possible from the present meta-analysis to draw any conclusions about any differences in penile size across different races. Lynn suggest that penis length and girth are greatest in Negroids (sub-Saharan Africans), intermediate in Caucasoids (Europeans, South Asians and North African), and smallest in Mongoloids (East Asians), but this is based upon studies that did not meet our present inclusion and exclusion criteria. The greatest proportion of the participants in the present meta-analysis were Caucasoids. There was only one study of 320 men in Negroids and two studies of 445 men in Mongoloids. There are no indications of differences in racial variability in our present study, e.g. the study from Nigeria was not a positive outlier. The question of racial variability can only be resolved by the measurements with large enough population being made by practitioners following the same method with other variables that may influence penis size (such as height) being kept constant. Future studies should also ensure they accurately report the race of their participants and conduct inter-rater reliability.

The moderating effect of age on the association between diversity and social cohesion for white residents provides further evidence in support of the idea that growing up in a multicultural society in which ethnic minorities play a visible and positive role serves to shift the attitudes and behaviours of younger ethnic majority cohorts in prosocial directions. [....] We include the following individual-level control variables that are plausibly related to both social cohesion and neighbourhood preference: age; sex; ethnic group; social class; marital status; housing tenure; and the length of time that an individual has lived in the area.

# consensus
all major relevant institutions agree that transgender identity (identifying as a different gender than one's birth sex) is not a disorder and that Gender Identity Disorder (GID) is best solved through counseling, social transition, and other forms of transition:

TLDR: **12 of 18 (66%) results** with clear results **suggest trans people have brain structures with similarities to their current gender identity.**
studies on gray matter, white matter, twins, and prenatal exposure all suggest -- albeit, with limited sample sizes and methods -- that transgender identity, like homosexuality, has a biological origin: <https://journals.aace.com/doi/abs/10.4158/EP14351.RA> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.4158/EP14351.RA> Although the mechanisms remain to be determined, there is strong support in the literature for a biologic basis of gender identity. [....] Current data suggest a biologic etiology for transgender identity. Studies of DSD patients and neuroanatomical studies provide the strongest evidence for the organic basis of transgender identity. Because the sample sizes of most studies on this subject were small, the conclusions must be interpreted with caution. Further research is required to assign specific biologic mechanisms for gender identity.

quoting an anti-trans source: alleged increase in bathroom incidents may be due to media change, not policy change: <http://womanmeanssomething.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-Longitudinal-Analysis-of-Media-Reports-at-Target-Stores.pdf> Another potential limitation of our analysis is that we don't know if pressure on Target has impacted media reporting. It may be that in some areas, perhaps in conservative locales, a bias may exist to report more of the total Target incidents occurring. It could also be that in other areas a liberal bias would lead to the suppression of news stories. We have noted a tendency in some states, usually liberal ones, to not report addresses of the incident locations. This may or may not be related to media bias.

hormone therapy decreased symptoms of mental distress for trans people to that of the general population: <https://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)30533-6/fulltext> A difference in SCL-90 overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P < 0.001). Significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility. Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated. Analysis of the psychosocial variables showed no significant differences between pre- and postoperative assessments.

of 22,725 sexual reassignment surgeries across 46 surgeons, 38 surgeries (.17%) were reversals and 62 patients (0.27%) regretted their surgery: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212091/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1097/01.GOX.0000547077.23299.00> Surgeons were asked to select a range representing the number of transgender patients they have surgically treated, and this amounted to a cumulative number of approximately 22,725 patients treated by the cohort. 49% of respondents had never encountered a patient who regretted their gender transition or were seeking detransition care. 12 providers encountered 1 patient with regret and the rest encountered more than one patient. This amounted to a total of 62 patients. There were 13 patients who regretted chest surgery and 45 patients who regretted genital surgery. The composition of the patients who sought detransition is as follows: 16 trans-men, 37 trans-women, and 6 non-binary patients. The most common reason cited for detransition was change in gender identity (22 patients) followed by rejection or alienation from family or social support (8 patients) and difficulty in romantic relationships (7 patients). Chronic post-operative pain was also cited as a reason for detransition. 7 trans-women who sought detransition had vaginal stenosis, 2 had rectovaginal fistulae, and 3 had chronic genital pain. 2 trans-men who sought detransition had a urethral fistula and one had a urethral stricture. 9 of the 46 respondents performed a total of 38 detransition procedures.
just 0.47% report regretting SRS in the UK: <https://epath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Boof-of-abstracts-EPATH2019.pdf> Of the 3398 patients who had appointments during this period, 16 (0.47%) expressed transition-related regret or detransitioned. Of these 16, one patient expressed regret but was not considering detransitioning, two had expressed regret and were considering detransitioning, three had detransitioned, and ten had detransitioned temporarily. The reasons stated by patients for their regret or detransition included: social factors, reporting physical complications, and changing their mind about their gender identity and identifying as their gender assigned at birth. The 16 patients consisted of 11 trans women, two trans men, two cis men, and one person assigned male at birth who said their gender identity was “trans”.
just 2.2% report regretting SRS in Sweden: <https://genderanalysis.net/2018/08/transgender-surgical-reversal-statistics-a-clearer-picture-emerges/> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24872188>
8% of trans people have ever socially detransitioned, 3% permanently: <https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf> ```Respondents were asked whether they had ever “de-transitioned,” which was defined as having “gone back to living as [their] sex assigned at birth, at least for a while.” Eight percent (8%) of respondents reported having de-transitioned at some point. Most of those who de-transitioned did so only temporarily: 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they were currently living full time in a gender different than the gender they were thought to be at birth.```

# debunk: sweden study
the study only used **non-transgender individuals** as the control; it cannot evaluate transition status as it affect suicide: <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885>  All 324 sex-reassigned persons (191 male-to-females, 133 female-to-males) in Sweden, 1973–2003. Random population controls (10:1) were matched by birth year and birth sex or reassigned (final) sex, respectively. [....] It is therefore important to note that the current study is only informative with respect to transsexual persons health after sex reassignment; no inferences can be drawn as to the effectiveness of sex reassignment as a treatment for transsexualism. In other words, the results should not be interpreted such as sex reassignment per se increases morbidity and mortality. Things might have been even worse without sex reassignment.
the author has repeatedly stated that her study doesn't support anti-SRS or pro-SRS beliefs: <https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm> <https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6q3e8v/science_ama_series_im_cecilia_dhejne_a_fellow_of/dkuk2tr/> People who misuse the study always omit the fact that the study clearly states that it is not an evaluation of gender dysphoria treatment. If we look at the literature, we find that several recent studies conclude that WPATH Standards of Care compliant treatment decrease gender dysphoria and improves mental health. [....] I have no good recommendation what to do. I have said many times that the study is not design to evaluate the outcome of medical transition. It DOES NOT say that medical transition causes people to commit suicide.

# debunk: williams institute study

# policy: bathrooms
bathroom policies reduce trans suicide rates: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2016.1157998: Transgender and gender non-conforming people frequently experience discrimination, harassment, and marginalization across college and university campuses (Bilodeau, 2007; Finger, 2010; Rankin et al., 2010; Seelman et al., 2012). The minority stress model (Meyer, 2007) posits that experiences of discrimination often negatively impact the psychological wellbeing of minority groups. However, few scholars have examined whether college institutional climate factors—such as being denied access to bathrooms or gender-appropriate campus housing—are significantly associated with detrimental psychological outcomes for transgender people. Using the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, this study analyzes whether being denied access to these spaces is associated with lifetime suicide attempts, after controlling for interpersonal victimization by students or teachers. Findings from sequential logistic regression (N = 2,316) indicate that denial of access to either space had a significant relationship to suicidality, even after controlling for interpersonal victimization. This article discusses implications for higher education professionals and researchers.

# affirmation: name

After adjusting for personal characteristics and total social support, chosen name use in more contexts predicted fewer depressive symptoms and less suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior (see Table 1). An increase by one context in which a chosen name could be used predicted a 5.37-unit decrease in depressive symptoms, a 29% decrease in suicidal ideation, and a 56% decrease in suicidal behavior.

Compared with national averages, transgender children showed typical rates of depression (p = .290) and marginally higher rates of anxiety (p = .096). Parents similarly reported that their transgender children experienced more anxiety than children in the control groups (p = .002) and rated their transgender children as having equivalent levels of depression (p = .728).

# rejection: suicide
self-reported experience of transphobia increases suicide ideation rate: https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2: Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR=0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR=0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.
self-reported stigma is associated with trans suicide attempt rates: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08964289.2015.1028322: This study assessed individual (ie, internalized transphobia) and structural forms of stigma as risk factors for suicide attempts among transgender adults. Internalized transphobia was assessed through a 26-item scale including four dimensions: pride, passing, alienation, and shame. State-level structural stigma was operationalized as a composite index, including density of same-sex couples; proportion of Gay–Straight Alliances per public high school; 5 policies related to sexual orientation discrimination; and aggregated public opinion toward homosexuality. Multivariable logistic generalized estimating equation models assessed associations of interest among an online sample of transgender adults (N = 1,229) representing 48 states and the District of Columbia. Lower levels of structural stigma were associated with fewer lifetime suicide attempts (AOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92–0.997), and a higher score on the internalized transphobia scale was associated with greater lifetime suicide attempts (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.33). Addressing stigma at multiple levels is necessary to reduce the vulnerability of suicide attempts among transgender adults.

Attention to this disparity has been limited, in part because neither the U.S. death certificate nor the NVDRS identify decedents’ sexual orientation or gender identity. Thus, it is not known whether LGBT people die by suicide at higher rates than comparable heterosexual people.

# suicide rate vs slaves
the completed suicide rate among slaves was ~.72 per 100,000 in the USA in 1850: <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1654> <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191102161632/https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> There are a few sources that provide numbers. Lester includes a table of suicide rates calculated from the 1850 census. 180 According to this, slaves in 1850 had a suicide rate of .72 per 100,000 while whites had a rate of 2.37 and freed slaves a rate of 1.15. P. D. Escott searched Federal Writer's Project Slave Narratives and documented resistance. In his list, which included a total of 413 incidents of resistance, there were seven incidents of suicide. This leaves suicide to account for 1.2% of incidents of resistance.
suicide among blacks is diminished by religiosity and self-perception: <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/1654> <https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> <http://web.archive.org/web/20191102161632/https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1654/KneelandL0506.pdf> However, today there are some black churches which teach that suicide is an unredeemable act. This teaching appears to have developed after Reconstruction but was very likely affected by attitudes toward suicide that trace back to slavery. In the early 1990s, Kevin Early conducted a sociological survey among black churches in Gainesville, Florida, and established that black pastors tend to view suicide as an unredeemable act. “The overall condemnation of suicide as sin remains clear. Terminal or painful disease is no excuse for giving up. It merely enhances the quality of life through struggle. After all, struggling is inherently part of the black experience.” 185 Early establishes that while pastors condemn both suicide and criminal behavior, they tend to label individuals involved in typical property and violent crimes, including homicide, as victims of their environment. They argue that parents were too hard on children, society did not offer them the same benefits as white families, and they did not have good economic or educational opportunities. 186 In contrast, when they discussed suicide, it was uniformly condemned as “sinful” and the belief was proposed that “adversity can be overcome without resorting to suicide.” 187 Blacks described themselves as “able to endure more hardship without succumbing to the despair and despondency that lead to suicide.” 188 Along that same idea, “African Americans view themselves as being more religious, more spiritual than their white counterparts, and more able to endure hardship.”

# casual sex
among straight single college students of both genders, casual sex in the past month correlated with lower well-being, lower life satisfaction, higher depression, and higher social anxiety: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2013.772088> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/00224499.2013.772088> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/655761086100013067/unknown.png n=3907, casual sex=whether "during the past 30 days they had sex with someone they knew for less than a week"
among sexually active high school students, after a six-month follow-up, among boys casual sex didn't correlate with psychological well-being, but among girls some categories of casual sex correlated with some categories of lower psychological well-being: <https://sci-hub.se/10.1080/00224499.2016.1255874> <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499.2016.1255874> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/655767216192487425/unknown.png n=2304, FWB = "sexual contact with your best friend or a friend", ONS = "sexual contact with an acquaintance or with a stranger"
Moreover, despite considerable literature suggesting that negative affective states promote risky sexual behavior, a meta-analysis found surprisingly limited substantiation of this link but left open the possibility that engaging in sexual risk taking may be associated with negative affect (see Crepaz & Marks, 2001).
By contrast, a recent study among a diverse sample of sexually active young adults (Eisenberg et al., 2009) found that individuals whose most recent sexual partner was a casual acquaintance were not at higher risk for depressive symptoms, low self-esteem, suicidal ideation, or body dissatisfaction compared to young adults who did not report casual sex.

# makeup
the most (perceived-as) effective romantic makeup methods are communication, apologing, forgiving, spending time together, compromising; men prefer "nice gestures", "giving sexual favors"; women prefer "spending time together", "crying", and "apologizing": <https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-reconcile-with-a-romantic-partner/> <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-017-0108-6> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s40806-017-0108-6> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636514003601981462/unknown.png
successful marriages require paying attention to your partner: <https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/> These bidding interactions had profound effects on marital well-being. Couples who had divorced after a six-year follow up had “turn-toward bids” 33 percent of the time. Only three in ten of their bids for emotional connection were met with intimacy. The couples who were still together after six years had “turn-toward bids” 87 percent of the time. Nine times out of ten, they were meeting their partner’s emotional needs.

Same-sex marriage policies were associated with a 0.6–percentage point (95% CI, –1.2 to –0.01 percentage points) reduction in suicide attempts, representing a 7% relative reduction in the proportion of high school students attempting suicide owing to same-sex marriage implementation.

sexuality (straight, bi, gay) and intimate partner violence (IPV): differences are only significant between bi women and straight women: <https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_victimization_final-a.pdf> <http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-and-Sexual-Abuse-among-LGBT-People.pdf> <https://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618175333014962198/unknown.png
most abuse rate studies are terrible: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X03003458> Probably the most difficult methodological obstacle in studying same-sex intimate violence is obtaining a representative sample; even studies based on large samples typically have used nonrandom sampling methods, with respondent recruitment often occurring through gay and lesbian publications, organizations, and activities [6]. Two studies with better methodology reported prevalence estimates of 25% and 17% for ever having experienced physical victimization in a lesbian relationship 12, 13; these figures are comparable to figures for heterosexual relationships.

# causes of homosexuality
the gay gene doesn't exist: <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-017-1092-4.pdf> However, the search for genes contributing to homosexuality, which started 25 years ago, has been largely unsuccessful. Although a recentlarge genome-wide association study (GWAS) by Sanders et al. (2015) has documented two chromosomal regions associated with male homosexuality (one X-linked, the other on autosome 8), which has resolved some conflicting results obtained from earlier attempts (Bailey et al.,1999; Hamer etal.,1993;Huetal.,1995;Mustanskietal.,2005;Ramagopalan, Dyment, Handunneththi, Rice, & Ebers, 2010; Rice, Anderson, Risch, & Ebers, 1999), both these regions have a small effect sizes and low power in predicting homosexual versus heterosexual orientation. Collectively, GWAS thus indicate that there are nomajor genes contributing to male homosexuality. No comparable studies on female homosexuality exist.
additional older brothers correlates with homosexuality, suggesting homosexuality may be increased by maternal biology: <https://www.newscientist.com/article/2156010-we-may-know-why-younger-brothers-are-more-likely-to-be-gay/> <https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/2/302.full.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/566408295607173125/unknown.png

anal sex appears to cause fecal incontinence: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5231615/> After multivariable adjustment for other factors associated with fecal incontinence, anal intercourse remained a predictor of fecal incontinence among women (POR: 1.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0–2.0) and men (POR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.6–5.0).
anal sex appears to cause fecal incontinence: <https://journals.lww.com/jpelvicsurgery/Abstract/2018/05000/Anal_Penetrative_Intercourse_as_a_Risk_Factor_for.10.aspx> Of women who engaged in API, 18% reported it changed their stool consistency, and 10% reported it caused AI. Having engaged in API within the last month was correlated with higher FISI scores (P = 0.05) and with fecal incontinence on the FISI (28.3% vs 14.4%; P = 0.01; odds ratio, 2.48).

in a sample of 269 child molesters, 237 (88%) were identified as heterosexual, while just 2 (0.7%) could be identified as potentially homosexual: <https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/94/1/41.long> <https://sci-hub.se/10.0000/pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/94/1/41> None of the alleged male offenders against female children was identified by the family or social service agencies as potentially homosexual. [....] Thus, the percentage of girls alleged to have been molested by potentially identifiable lesbian women was 0.4% (1/219). [....] Using the criterion that the alleged offender might possibly be identifiable as being homosexual by the caretaker, there was one male child potentially offended against by ahomosexual male (1 /50 = 2%). [....] Heterosexual relationships were documented for 237 (88%) of the alleged adult offenders.

# rates
in a worldwide metastudy, being the victim of child sexual abuse was about 3x higher for male homosexuals than male heterosexuals and about 2x higher for female homosexuals than female heterosexuals: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10538712.2015.1006746> <https://sci-hub.tw/10.1080/10538712.2015.1006746> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638347070880743424/unknown.png This meta-analysis revealed no significant difference between the prevalence of CSA across lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals. This was true for both sexes; the prevalence of CSA among male sexual minorities was 22.2% and for female sexual minorities was 36.2%. These values appear to differ widely from those of heterosexual people: Pereda and colleagues (2009b) found that the prevalence of CSA was 7.9% in men and 19.7% in women in general sample, and Stoltenborgh and colleagues (2011) found that the prevalence of CSA was 7.6% in men and 18.0% in women. Thus, we might conclude that the prevalence of CSA among sexual minorities is higher than that among heterosexuals.
in a USA metastudy, homosexuals were 1-4x more likely to be the victim of child sexual abuse: <https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2009.190009> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.2105/AJPH.2009.190009> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/638346922096066560/unknown.png Sexual minority individuals were on average 3.8, 1.2, 1.7, and 2.4 times more likely to experience sexual abuse, parental physical abuse, or assault at school or to miss school through fear, respectively.

# causes
causation may be reversed: gender-nonconforming children are more likely to be abused, not vice versa: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1079063215618378> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/1079063215618378> The instrumental variable analysis revealed that the increased prevalence of CSA experienced by nonheterosexuals compared with heterosexuals may be due to the influence of sexual orientation on CSA. In sum, the results suggest that nonheterosexuality may increase the risk of childhood sexual abuse.

# sexual education (sex ed)
#####o
sex ed should be started in kindergarten: https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/08/the-benefits-of-starting-sex-ed-at-age-4/568225/ On average, Dutch and American teenagers have sex for the first time around the same age—between 17 and 18—but with dramatically different results. Teen pregnancy has been on the decline in the U.S. for the past three decades, but American teenagers still give birth at five times the rate of their Dutch peers, who also have fewer abortions. In the United States, people under 25 make up half of all new STI cases each year, while young people in the Netherlands account for 10 percent of new cases in the country. Socially, sex is different, too: Sexually active young people in Holland sleep around less, communicate more often with their partners about their likes and dislikes, and report higher rates of sexual satisfaction.

For example, individually delivered parent training is far superior to group delivered parent training in helping families facing economic disadvantage. Also, there is no support for including supplements to basic parent training and parent training seems to be robust against age effects.

# orchid hypothesis: biological sensitivity to context [unformatted]
At the outset of their study, Bakermans-Kranenburg and her colleagues had screened 2,408 children via parental questionnaire, and they were now focusing on the 25 percent rated highest by their parents in externalizing behaviors. Lab observations had confirmed these parental ratings. Bakermans-Kranenburg meant to change the kids’ behavior. In an intervention her lab had developed, she or another researcher visited each of 120 families six times over eight months; filmed the mother and child in everyday activities, including some requiring obedience or cooperation; and then edited the film into teachable moments to show to the mothers. A similar group of high-externalizing children received no intervention. https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-19851-030 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-18728-008 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-22003-002 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/effects-of-an-attachmentbased-intervention-on-daily-cortisol-moderated-by-dopamine-receptor-d4-a-randomized-control-trial-on-1-to-3yearolds-screened-for-externalizing-behavior/01F6FD4F410A19F657EBDE5C96A2F777

# blame
<https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states> The reasons patients gave for having an abortion underscored their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. The three most common reasons—each cited by three-fourths of patients—were concern for or responsibility to other individuals; the inability to afford raising a child; and the belief that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents. Half said they did not want to be a single parent or were having problems with their husband or partner.7 Fifty-one percent of abortion patients in 2014 were using a contraceptive method in the month they became pregnant, most commonly condoms (24%) or a hormonal method (13%).8

W skali całego społeczeństwa daje to od 4,1 do 5,8 mln kobiet. [Not less than 1/4 but not more than 1/3 of adult Polish women have interrupted their pregnancy during their life, with high probability. On the scale of the whole society this gives between 4.1 and 5.8 million women.] <http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/uslifetimeab.html> Summary: It is estimated here that, as of 2008, about 28% of U.S. women ages 15-64 have had abortions. This figure has risen from 2.8% in 1973 to 11% in 1980, 19% in 1987, 24% in 1994, and 27% in 2001. In 2008, of women ages 40-55, about 40% have had abortions in their lifetimes.
studies by the Polish Federation for Women and Family Planning provide similar estimates of 1/4 lifetime exposure and yearly counts of 100,000+: <https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/138222/thesis_Ewa_Hirvonen.pdf?sequence=1> <http://wyborcza.pl/7,87648,20314186,zasadzka-na-anestezjologa.html> <http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,8300922,Polskie_aborcje_w_klinikach_calej_Europy.html> For instance Wanda Nowicka, head of the Federation for Women and Family Planning, estimated in 2010 that approximately 80 000-200 000 Polish women terminate unintended pregnancies every year. According to her, 10-15% of these abortions are induced abroad. (Dubrowska 2010.) This estimation would mean that up to 30 000 Polish women travel each year abroad to seek abortion. According to the latest estimations of the Federation for Women and Family Planning (2016), over 100 000 abortions are induced every year in Poland, meaning that every fourth Polish woman has experienced an abortion.

# Invisible Victims: Delayed Onset Depression among Adults with Same-Sex Parents
sullins' study: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4903140/>
sullins counted any child who ever lived in a household headed by a gay person as a child growing up in a same-sex household -- including single or divorced parents: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5204108/> Sullins achieves this through a crucial elision between households in which a child spent some time in a home headed by a same-sex couple and families in which a child was actually raised, from birth, by a stable same-sex couple, a situation more auspicious for healthy child development. This conflation of household stability with parent gender fatally mars his conclusions, which are much more damning of gay and lesbian parenting than are warranted by his data. [....] This descriptor, of course, is the key variable in the discourse on optimal child-rearing because of the well-established fact that children who experience divorce or other family disruptions are at higher risk for a number of disadvantages, including the ones that Sullins inaccurately associates with “same-sex parented” households. What Sullins has done makes no more sense than surveying a hospital to derive mortality rates. It is hard to imagine that Sullins does not know this and equally hard to watch his misleading findings get past peer review.

# gay parenting
the American Psychological Association believes sexuality is not a significant predictor of parenting outcomes: <http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/gay-parents-as-good-as-straight-ones/> <http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2013/03/18/peds.2013-0377.full.pdf> On the basis of this comprehensive review of the literature regarding the development and adjustment of children whose parents are the same gender, as well as the existing evidence for the legal, social, and health benefits of marriage to children, the AAP concludes that it is in the best interests of children that they be able to partake in the security of permanent nurturing and care that comes with the civil marriage of their parents, without regard to their parents’ gender or sexual orientation.
75 studies demonstrate that same-sex couples and different-sex couples produce roughly equivalent children: <https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-wellbeing-of-children-with-gay-or-lesbian-parents/>  A 2010 study by Stanford researcher Michael Rosenfeld used census data to examine the school advancement of 3,500 children with same-sex parents, finding no significant differences between households headed by same-sex and opposite-sex parents when controlling for family background. Another study drew on nationally representative, longitudinal data using a sampling pool of over 20,000 children, of which 158 lived in a same-sex parent household. Controlling for family disruptions, those children showed no significant differences from their peers in school outcomes.
in meta-analysis, two dads vs two moms was insignificant: <https://thewinnower.com/papers/3532-knowing-what-we-don-t-know-a-meta-analysis-of-children-raised-by-gay-or-lesbian-parents>  A third potential explanation, based on theories of gender development (Leaper & Friedman, 2007; McHale, Crouter, & Whiteman, 2003), has to do with the presence of a parent of the same or opposite gender as the child. There was, however, no support for this explanation. Children raised by gay fathers were no different than children raised by lesbian mothers, and the differences associated with parent sexual orientation did not vary between boys and girls.
in meta-analysis, same-sex parents appear to do worse on some indicators (internalizing, externalizing, social competence, academic competence) and better on others (positive relationships, parental warmth), but the data is usually of such poor quality that no reliable conclusions can be drawn (the moderator effects have larger size than the effect size): <https://thewinnower.com/papers/3532-knowing-what-we-don-t-know-a-meta-analysis-of-children-raised-by-gay-or-lesbian-parents> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/587971826961874951/unknown.png

The proposal would allow the presumed father, the biological father or the mother to challenge the paternity until a child turns 2. The proposal had two goals: to balance the rights of children with those of their presumed fathers and to encourage parentage questions to be raised early in a child’s life, before deep bonds are formed. Several states, including Delaware, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, have adopted that model or a variation of it.

circumcision neonatal deaths probably don't exist: <https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/science/benefits-of-circumcision-outweigh-risks-pediatric-group-says.html> By one estimate, put forth by Dan Bollinger, a prominent opponent of circumcision, based on his review of infant mortality statistics, about 117 boys die each year as a result of circumcision. That estimate is cited often by critics of routine circumcision but widely disputed by medical professionals. A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the agency did not keep track of deaths from infant circumcision because they are exceedingly rare. In the agency’s last mortality report, which looked at all deaths in the country in 2010, no circumcision-related deaths were found.

<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127372/> He made no mention of male circumcision, yet there is now compelling epidemiological evidence from over 40 studies which shows that male circumcision provides significant protection against HIV infection; circumcised males are two to eight times less likely to become infected with HIV.2 Furthermore, circumcision also protects against other sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea,3,4 and since people who have a sexually transmitted infection are two to five times more likely to become infected with HIV,5 circumcision may be even more protective. No new infections occurred among any of the 50 circumcised men over 30 months, whereas 40 of 137 uncircumcised men became infected during this time. Both groups had been given free access to HIV testing, intensive instruction about preventing infection, and free condoms (which were continuously available), but 89% of the men never used condoms, and condom use did not seem to influence the rate of transmission of HIV.

Similarly, girls might have scored higher than boys in science, but they were often even better in reading. Critically, the magnitude of these sex differences in personal academic strengths and weaknesses was strongly related to national gender equality, with larger differences in more gender-equal nations. These intraindividual differences in turn may contribute, for instance, to parental beliefs that boys are better at science and mathematics than girls (Eccles & Jacobs, 1986; Gunderson, Ramirez, Levine, & Beilock, 2012). We also found that boys often expressed higher selfefficacy, more joy in science, and a broader interest in science than did girls. These differences were also larger in more gender-equal countries and were related to the students’ personal academic strength.
^studies using the implicit association test to refute this study have really, really bad sample selection bias: <http://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerEaglyLinn2015.pdf> "Women’s Representation in Science Predicts National Gender-Science Stereotypes: Evidence From 66 Nations": Participants found the Project Implicit website mainly through links from other websites, media coverage, search engines, and word of mouth (Nosek et al., 2002). The website was available in 17 different languages and hosted on various web servers across the world. Participants choose the gender-science task from a list of five to 12 topics (e.g., implicit age attitudes, implicit racial attitudes). Participants therefore self-selected into the sample by having Internet access, learning about the Project Implicit website, visiting the website, and choosing the gender-science task. The Results and Limitations sections consider the influence of possible self-selection biases. <https://www.pnas.org/content/106/26/10593> "National differences in gender–science stereotypes predict national sex differences in science and math achievement"
sex differences in Big Five personality traits and occupational preferences were mostly consistent across countries, with more gender-equal countries actually having *higher* variation in agreeableness: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-008-9380-7> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/s10508-008-9380-7> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618482883895492648/unknown.png
data from Swedish male-female twins suggests that male and female distributions of personality on the Big Five are ~1 standard deviation apart and that genetics explains ~1/3 of these differences; prenatal hormones also probably affect these differences: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/individual-differences-in-personality-masculinityfemininity-examining-the-effects-of-genes-environment-and-prenatal-hormone-transfer/C5C72DBFD24FA1E7D9B460B9047F43FC/core-reader> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1017/thg.2016.8> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/618488340806631434/unknown.png On average, males scored 1.09 standard deviations higher on the discriminant score than females, indicating a large effect size (males Mean = 0.64 [SD = 1.01], females Mean=-0.45 [SD = 0.99]). The canonical correlation between participants’ sex and the discriminant score was 0.47, indicating that the personality items combined can explain 22% of the group membership (Wilks’ Lambda = 0.78, p < .001). Based on the discriminant function, the sex of 72% of participants could be correctly classified. [....] Males with a male co-twin scored on average 0.61 (SD = 1.00) and males with a female-co-twin 0.70 (SD = 1.01) on the derived M-F personality scale. Females with a female co-twin scored on average -0.49 (SD = 0.99) and females with a male-co-twin -0.38 (SD = 1.01). So, both male and female participants from opposite-sex pairs scored significantly higher on the M-F personality scale (both approximately 0.1 SD more masculine) than did males and females from same-sex pairs. [....] [B]road-sense heritability estimates are 35% for males and 33% for females. Also, we found some evidence for non-additive genetic influences, especially for females. The majority of the variance in the derived personality score can be explained by residual influences, including non-shared environmental influences and measurement error.
females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who cannot produce androgen (a sex hormone) were shifted towards male preferences on the "things-people" scale: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166361/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565946988328124417/unknown.png The results support the hypothesis that sex differences in occupational interests are due, in part, to prenatal androgen influences on differential orientation to objects versus people. Compared to unaffected females, females with CAH reported more interest in occupations related to Things versus People, and relative positioning on this interest dimension was substantially related to amount of prenatal androgen exposure. Females with CAH scored in between males and typical females on the Things-People dimension; their intermediate score might reflect a dose effect of prenatal androgen or the feminizing effects of socialization or other biological factors related to XX karyotype.

# social conditioning
performing gender may cause hormone differences (rather than the reverse): <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653185/> Using a novel experimental design, participants (trained actors) performed a specific type of competition (wielding power) in stereotypically masculine vs. feminine ways. We hypothesized in H1 (stereotyped behavior) that wielding power increases testosterone regardless of how it is performed, vs. H2 (stereotyped performance), that wielding power performed in masculine but not feminine ways increases testosterone. We found that wielding power increased testosterone in women compared with a control, regardless of whether it was performed in gender-stereotyped masculine or feminine ways. Results supported H1 over H2: stereotyped behavior but not performance modulated testosterone. These results also supported theory that competition modulates testosterone over masculinity. Our findings thus support a gender→testosterone pathway mediated by competitive behavior. Accordingly, cultural pushes for men to wield power and women to avoid doing so may partially explain, in addition to heritable factors, why testosterone levels tend to be higher in men than in women: A lifetime of gender socialization could contribute to “sex differences” in testosterone. Our experiment opens up new questions of gender→testosterone pathways, highlighting the potential of examining nature/nurture interactions and effects of socialization on human biology.

# divorce necessary: conflict bad
high-conflict married families were just as likely to have negative outcomes as were single mothers: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930824/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2010.03.002> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636527287981965362/unknown.png Despite caveats concerning potential underestimates of conflict, we find that children from high conflict married-parent families do more poorly in the domains of schooling and substance use, and are at greater risk of early family formation and dissolution, relative to children from low conflict married-parent families. In half of our outcomes, high conflict, stepfather, and single-mother families are statistically indistinguishable in their associations with young adult well-being. [....] Compared to those from low conflict married-parent families, the risks of each of our family-related transitions are anywhere from 25% to upwards of 100% greater for children from high conflict married-parent, stepfather, and single-mother families (not statistically significant in the case of high conflict married-parent families and early cohabitation). Risks also tend to be greater for children from stepfather and single-mother families, relative to children from high conflict married-parent families, although differences are not consistently statistically significant (see “key contrasts”).
mothers who are single by choice (rather than separation, divorce, death, etc.) had insignificantly different parenting outcomes from married mothers, except that single mothers had less-frequent "battles" with children: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886836/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1037/fam0000188> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636529228954861588/unknown.png There were no differences in parenting quality between family types apart from lower mother–child conflict in solo mother families. Neither were there differences in child adjustment. Perceived financial difficulties, child’s gender, and parenting stress were associated with children’s adjustment problems in both family types. The findings suggest that solo motherhood, in itself, does not result in psychological problems for children.

# weak effect: crime
the rate of single motherhood *today* has a large, significant positive correlation with crime -- but single motherhood *18 years ago* had a small, significant negative correlation with crime: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1069397104267479> Regression analyses that controlled for masculinity of the population (sex ratio of 15- to 64-year-olds) and national wealth (log gross national product, GNP, per capita) found that current single parenthood ratios were strongly and consistently predictive of violent crimes, whereas single parenthood ratios 18 years ago were not. [....] Even more remarkable were the regression results, in which a large positive effect of 1991 illegitimacy ratios on all violent-crime measures was produced. None of the regressions produced a positive relationship between 1972 illegitimacy ratios and crime, providing a remarkably clear rejection of the parental investment hypothesis in favor of the mating competition prediction.

# weak effect: variety
single parenthood explained just 1% of the variation of adult outcomes: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/482426> In agreement with much previous research into the effects of single parenthood on children, increasing exposure to a single-parent family in childhood was associated with increasing risks of later anxiety, poorer educational and economic outcomes, and criminal offending. However, these associations were rather weak, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.01 to 0.22 (median, 0.10). These results imply that, typically, variation in exposure to single parenthood accounted for about 1% of the variation in outcomes in adulthood. These statistics reflected the facts that (1) most of those exposed to single parenthood did not develop later difficulties and (2) many of those developing later difficulties were not exposed to single parenthood.
anxiety disorder rates, university degree rates, welfare dependence, income, arrest or conviction rates, and property or violence offences were insignificantly correlated with single motherhood: <https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/482426> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640935399824556045/yoa70019t2.png Table 2 shows that, when due allowance was made for social and contextual factors associated with single parenthood, the duration of exposure to single parenthood during childhood was largely unrelated to later outcomes. There were only 2 possible exceptions to this trend; after adjustment, significant associations (P < .05) remained between exposure to single parenthood and later anxiety disorder and welfare dependence. At the same time, given the many comparisons made in Table 2, these associations could be due to chance variation as a result of multiple tests of significance. To address this issue, a Bonferroni-adjusted38P value (P < .007) was used to correct for multiple (n = 7) tests of significance. In this instance, the adjusted associations between exposure to single parenthood and later anxiety disorder and between single parenthood and welfare dependence were not statistically significant (P > .007) using the Bonferroni correction.

a consensus study by the National Academies finds that immigration to the US increases economic growth and doesn't reduce wages: <https://www.nap.edu/catalog/23550/the-economic-and-fiscal-consequences-of-immigration>
a meta-analysis of several immigration studies finds almost no effect on native wages or native employment: <https://research.vu.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/2853421> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/495039000365760525/unknown.png We find small wage and employment impacts, even smaller than have been detected in previous metaanalytic research. A 1% point increase in the share of immigrants in a local labour market of the typical host country decreases wages of the native born by 0.029% (using a weighted average with weights determined by the precision of the estimates) and decreases employment of the native born by 0.011%.
immigration to the US slightly increases wages for natives, slightly decreases wages for low-education natives, and significantly decreases wages for immigrants: <https://academic.oup.com/jeea/article/10/1/152/2182016> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/j.1542-4774.2011.01052.x> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/495037831949975553/m_jeea0152-08.png In the long run, these estimates imply an overall average positive effect of immigration on native wages of about 0.6% and an overall average negative effect on the wages of previous immigrants of about −6%. [....] All in all, one finding seems robust: once imperfect substitutability between natives and immigrants is allowed for, over the period 1990–2006 immigration to the United States had at most a modest negative long-run effect on the real wages of the least educated natives. This effect is between −2.1% and +1.7% depending on the chosen nesting structure, with the positive results coming from the nesting structure preferred by the data. Our finding at the national level of a small wage effect of immigration on less-educated natives is in line with the findings identified at the city level.
immigration is a net positive for the economy, but unequally benefits the high-skilled: <https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/589756> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1086/589756> The wage effects are sizeable but plausible: a 10 percent increase in the number of low-skilled immigrants in a city reduces the wages of low-skilled natives by 0.6 percent and of low-skilled immigrants by 8 percent (an own-labor demand elasticity of -1.2). My results imply that the low-skilled immigration wave of the 1990s increased the purchasing power of high-skilled workers living in the 25 largest cities by an average of 0.65 percent and decreased the purchasing power of native high school dropouts by an average of 2.66 percent. I conclude that, through lower prices, low-skilled immigration brings positive net benefits to the US economy as a whole, but generates a redistribution of wealth: it reduces the real income of low-skilled natives and increases the real income of high-skilled natives.

# economic growth
states with more foreign-born workers experience faster TFP (productivity) growth: <https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/REST_a_00137> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1162/REST_a_00137> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/498666483212091392/unknown.png

about half of illegal immigrants pay taxes, and they pay at rates close to what they would pay if they were legal: <https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/undocumentedtaxes.pdf> Undocumented immigrants currently contribute significantly to state and local taxes, collectively paying an estimated $10.6 billion in 2010 with contributions ranging from less than $2 million in Montana to more than $2.2 billion in California. This means these families are likely paying about 6.4 percent on average of their income in state and local taxes. Allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States legally would increase their state and local tax contributions by an estimated $2 billion a year. Their effective state and local tax rate would also increase to 7 percent on average, which would put their tax contributions more in line with documented taxpayers with similar incomes.
people without social security numbers paid $23.6bn in income taxes in 2015: <https://www.vox.com/2019/3/1/18241692/undocumented-immigrants-pay-state-local-taxes> <http://taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Media/Default/Documents/2015ARC/ARC15_Volume1_MSP_18_ITIN.pdf>

# american historic
immigration restrictions in the 1910's and 20's caused the immigrant population to age relative to the native one -- and thus saw a corresponding decline in relative crime: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2831353/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/542377842701369374/unknown.png By 1930, as shown in the top panel, more than half of the foreign-born population was over the age of 30, and more than 10% were 65 or older. These differences in age distributions can have a profound effect on perceptions of relative criminality because age is so strongly correlated with criminal behavior. Crime rates peak for males in late adolescence and decline rather precipitously thereafter. **Comparisons of native and immigrant criminality in 1930 that do not control for these differences in age distributions will necessarily bias the results in favor of immigrants.**

# posterity: founder quotes (inclusive)
John Adams: immigrants must "shed their European skin" (ie, preference for privilegia) for American equal rights: <https://thefederalist.com/2014/08/18/what-john-quincy-adams-said-about-immigration-will-blow-your-mind/> <https://archive.org/stream/nilesweeklyregis18balt#page/157/mode/1up> Emigrants from Germany, therefore, or from elsewhere, coming here, are not to expect favors from the governments. They are to expect, if they choose to become citizens, equal rights with those of the natives of the country. They are to expect, if affluent, to possess the means of making their property productive, with moderation, and with safety;—if indigent, but industrious, honest and frugal, the means of obtaining easy and comfortable subsistence for themselves and their families. [....] To one thing they must make up their minds, or, they will be disappointed in every expectation of happiness as Americans. They must cast off the European skin, never to resume it. They must look forward to their posterity, rather than backward to their ancestors; they must be sure that whatever their own feelings may be, those of their children will cling to the prejudices of this country, and will partake of that proud spirit, not unmingled with disdain, which you have observed is remarkable in the general character of this people, and as perhaps belonging peculiarly to those of German descent, born in this country.
George Washington: the USA should be an "asylum to the virtuous and persecuted": <https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/04-06-02-0266> I had always hoped that this land might become a safe & agreeable Asylum to the virtuous & persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong; but I shall be the more particularly happy, if this Country can be, by any means, useful to the Patriots of Holland, with whose situation I am peculiarly touched, and of whose public virtue I entertain a great opinion.

# posterity: founder quotes (exclusive)
Benjamin Franklin: Anglo-Saxons are white, "Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians", "Swedes", and "Germans" are "tawny" and should not be "increased in number": <http://www.columbia.edu/~lmg21/ash3002y/earlyac99/documents/observations.html> Which leads me to add one Remark: That the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionably very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light to the Eyes of Inhabitants in Mars or Venus, why should we in the Sight of Superior Beings, darken its People? why increase the Sons of Africa, by Planting them in America, where we have so fair an Opportunity, by excluding all Blacks and Tawneys, of increasing the lovely White and Red? But perhaps I am partial to the Compexion of my Country, for such Kind of Partiality is natural to Mankind.

in 2015, 1% of police reports are attributed to asylum seekers and 1.8% of the Swedish population were asylum seekers <http://cpsblog.isr.umich.edu/?p=1905> If asylum-seekers are particularly crime-prone, then we would expect to see crime rates in which they are overrepresented relative to how many are living in Sweden. Sweden hosted approximately 180,000 asylum-seekers during this period and the population of Sweden is approximately 10 million.

according to police reports data in Sweden, the rape rate hasn't significantly changed between 2008 and 2015 (the rape law was reformed in 2005): <http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/04/19/what-crime-data-from-sweden-can-and-cannot-tell-us/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640936603195539466/Screen-Shot-2017-04-05-at-5.png
according to police reports data in Sweden, the rate of rape has only slightly increased since 2015 (the rape law was reformed in 2005): <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkjkU2w6jhw> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/567774881043841081/unknown.png
convictions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden> The number of convictions has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, with approximately 190 convictions on average each year.[9][10] The total number of convictions for rape and aggravated rape in Sweden 2015 was 176.

# sweden: sexual assault
Sweden changed its definition of sexual assault in 2005 and in 2013 <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/24/no-sweden-isnt-hiding-an-immigrant-crime-problem-this-is-the-real-story/> <http://archive.is/T5IuS> In Sweden, the legal definition of sexual assault is much broader than it is in the U.S. and even other European countries. While the rate of rape has remained steady in Sweden over the past decade, changes to the legal definition of sexual assault in 2005 and 2013 resulted in increases in reported sexual assault — because more acts now fall within the legal definition and are therefore officially counted. Thus, the standard of accountability has increased.
2005 reform: After, sex with a person in a "helpless state" (e.g. intoxicated, asleep) was sexual assault: <https://www.regeringen.se/49bb66/contentassets/a0f8b372714a4377a1a507e50f0c3666/en-ny-sexualbrottslagstiftning>
2013 reform: Previously, sex with a person in "helpless state" was sexual assault; after, a person in a "particularly vulnerable situation" was sexual assault. <https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/arende/betankande/en-skarpt-sexualbrottslagstiftning_H001JuU20>

why not to use SCS (NTU) data: <http://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2017/04/19/what-crime-data-from-sweden-can-and-cannot-tell-us/> Many people responded to our articles by citing data from the National Crime Survey (NTU) on an increase from 1% to 1.7% in sexual assault. In doing so, they misunderstood the important distinction between sexual offense and rape. While the NTU survey includes a question about rape, it has not released the raw data or discussed the findings. There are two likely reasons for this. First, there are so few cases of rape in the survey data that they cannot confidently make estimates about its occurrence in the population. Second, the authors of the report believe that respondents’ perceptions may not be accurate reflections of the legal distinctions between various categories of sex offenses. While the NTU is not confident in making precise estimates of the occurrence of rape, it does believe the data are sufficient to conclude that the rate of rape and other forms of coercive sexual offenses (“sexuellt tvång”) is higher than data from the police reports indicate. This means that there is underreporting by victims. Unfortunately, we cannot estimate how the probability of a victim reporting a sexual offense event has changed from year to year, and this affects our ability to draw conclusions about trends in the rape data.

# sweden: debunk these
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Sweden> In August 2018 SVT reported that rape statistics in Sweden show that 58% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape over the past five years were born outside of the European Union: Southern Africans, Northern Africans, Arabs, Middle Easterns, and Afghans.[11][12] Swedish Television's investigating journalists found that in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of foreign-born sex offenders was more than 80%.[11]

# statistics: overall
farm murders have never been lower than now, according to the South African Police Service (this number includes all murders of all people (owners, workers, visitors, family) on all farms, including smallholdings (but not nonfarming smallholdings)); note the gap of 2007-2009: <https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/farm-murder-rate-lowest-in-20-years-remoteness-the-reason-for-brutality-20180531> <https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-statistics-farm-attacks-murders-sa/> <https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AgriSA_Farm-Attacks_V1.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574722108915974185/unknown.png
SA has 35000 commercial farm owners, 10300 family members of commercial farm owners, 771000 commercial farm employees, and 4000000 smallholding farm owners <https://www.news24.com/Columnists/GuestColumn/afriforums-own-farm-murder-stats-dont-support-their-claims-20180507> <https://www.nda.agric.za/docs/statsinfo/Censcoagric2007.pdf> <https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/212633/2/Pienaar-Understanding%20the%20smallholder%20farmer%20in%20South%20Africa-1233.pdf> The number of "farm murders" is 47; this includes smallholders. Using different definitions of "farmer" results in wildly different murder rates. Including just commercial farm owners, we get 134 murders per 100000. Including family, 103 per 100000. Including workers, 5.75 per 100000. Including smallholders, 0.975 per 100000. SA's murder rate is 34 per 100000 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_South_Africa>
alternately, AfricaCheck argues that statistic calculation is impossible: <https://africacheck.org/2017/05/08/analysis-calculating-farm-murder-rate-sa-near-impossible/> Previously, Burger used Statistics South Africa’s 2007 census of commercial agriculture’s estimate of 32,375 full-time farmers to indicate the murder rate of farmers. This was how he calculated that there were 133 farm murders per 100,000 farmers, using the Transvaal Agricultural Union of South Africa’s estimate of 39 farmers murdered in 2012. Chris van Zyl, the union’s assistant general, told Africa Check that the recorded murders included farmers on non-commercial farms and agricultural smallholdings. Burger excluded family members, workers and visitors from the calculation. However, the 2007 figure of 32,375 full-time farmers is not appropriate to use, as the survey was only conducted on commercial farms registered to pay value-added tax (VAT). [....] The survey also estimated that there were an additional 10,272 family members involved in farming activities, 4,923 owners in partnership directly involved in farming activities and 770,933 paid employees. Including the full-time farmers, this added up to 818,503. If this farming population is used, the farm murder rate for 2015/16 would be 5.6 murders per 100,000 people living and/or working on farms registered to pay value-added tax. However, the total population of people living on farms and smallholdings, which do not pay value-added tax, will be larger.

# statistics: race
the Boer-dominated Transvaal Agricultural Union's data on farm murders shows a very variable white farm murder count, making trend analysis difficult: <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724> <https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4428330-Farm-Murders-Racial-Breakdown-1990-2018.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574720347585380362/unknown.png
according to the South African Police Service, 74% of farm murders were white and 83% were farm owners: <https://africacheck.org/factsheets/factsheet-south-africas-crime-statistics-for-2017-18/> In 2017/18, the police recorded 62 murders during 58 attacks. Of those murdered, 52 were the owners or occupiers of the farm/smallholding, 9 were farm workers and one was a farm manager. Forty-two murders took place on farms, 15 on smallholdings and one at a cattle post. The majority of the murder victims (46) were white.

# statistics: reliability
reliability (or lack thereof) of the statistics: <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724> Dr de Kock told Fact Check that the police's farm murder count was reliable. But he said the "biggest problem" with the data was that police stations do not specifically record hate-based murders or "farm murders". "So a murder, wherever that murder happens, whatever the motive for that murder, will just be registered as a murder." Dr de Kock also pointed out that more than half of farm attacks or murders take place on "small holdings", usually plots of one or two hectares on the edge of towns and cities. "In many cases people don't actually farm on those," he said, explaining that while some people might farm on a small scale, "strictly speaking [they're] no commercial farmer". Dr Burger said the lack of regular government statistics on farm attacks and murders makes it "extremely difficult to accurately define the extent of the problem". But he also said the union works hard to ensure the credibility of its data, which he relies on himself. And according to Dr Burger, murder statistics reported by different groups tended to be similar.

The statemetn is made bearing in mind all research conducted in previous hearings and governmetn commissions of inquiries. Racial tensions have been present in South Africa for many decades and continue to be the case in democratic South Africa. [.....] Safety and security challenges persist in farming communities. Violence in farming communities is not based on the ground of race but reflects a reality where issues of racial segregation, land tenure, and economic [dis]empowerment provide the context for considering the root causes of crime which occur in farming communities. In addition, the Commission notes that the term "farm attacks and/or murder" i[s] inappropriate.

[....] Christians adopted approaches to welfare that were new to Roman eyes. The very first community of Christians, in first-century Jerusalem, hosted free communal meals; deacons were appointed to oversee distribution of the common fund that had been endowed by wealthy members of the congregation though property sales (Acts 4–6). [....] Tertullian bracketed his community’s income, deposita pietatis, with corresponding spending on beneficiaries, alumni confessionis. [....] Christianity was on the pathway to a model of society where, according to Andrea Giardina (2007, p. 768), ‘poverty assumed a central position, in the collective imagination as in the redistribution of wealth’. [....] Ambrose was an unbending defender of property rights, in particular of the right of the church to own property, quite logically so because such rights were a prerequisite for dispensing benevolentia. [....] Sermons such as these had practical implications for welfare provision. Lists of paupers eligible for support were compiled, called matricula; according to John Chrysostomos, in Antioch the number came to 3,000 (John Chrysostomos 1888, pp. 706–7).n

# britain: liberal
British Muslims are becoming more liberal: <https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/review-survey-research-muslims-britain-0> <https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/publication/documents/2018-03/a-review-of-survey-research-on-muslims-in-great-britain-ipsos-mori_0.pdf>
A majority of Muslims disagree that homosexuality should be legal in Britain: 38% strongly disagree and 14% tend to disagree, whereas only 8% strongly agree and 10% tend to agree. (By way of comparison, 73% of the whole adult public (and 67% of Christians) said that it should be legal in the control group survey with a representative sample from the same poll. But although Muslims’ views are now out of line with the more liberal views of the British public as a whole, it should perhaps be borne in mind that as recently as 1993 the British Social Attitudes survey found 50% of the adult British public believing that “sexual relations between two adults of the same sex” were “always wrong”.) **Young Muslims are significantly more likely to agree that homosexuality should be legal (28% of 18-24 year olds, 23% of 25-34 year olds),** but even in these age groups there was a clear plurality against: as many 18-24 year olds strongly disagree as agree, strongly or otherwise, and among 25-34 year olds almost twice as many do so.
Many of the surveys that have been conducted explore the extent to which Muslims feel their religion is compatible with life in Britain and support for integration. Most Muslims (83%) – and, indeed, most Britons regardless of religion (66%) - agree that “it is possible to fully belong to Britain and maintain a separate cultural or religious identity”; 40% of Muslims strongly agree. And seven in ten Muslims (72%) reject the idea that Western liberal society is incompatible with Islam which contrasts with the perception in the British population that Islam and British values are incompatible (please see section 12 further in this report). This is further supported by the large number of British Muslims who say they have a strong sense of British identity (see page 36).

# terrorism efficacy
relative to civil wars led by nonterrorist rebel groups, terrorist rebel groups were 15x less likely to achieve victory and 2x less likely to reach an agreement with the government: <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/do-terrorists-win-rebels-use-of-terrorism-and-civil-war-outcomes/4729B2B926904616190DC38DB3240C8F> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/S0020818315000089> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/656629320332083210/unknown.png
relative to nondemocratic government, civil wars led by terrorist rebel groups against democratic governments less (rather than more) likely to fail, but not more likely to succeed (or: terrorism is better at elongating wars against democracies than nondemocracies, but not at actually winning them): <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/do-terrorists-win-rebels-use-of-terrorism-and-civil-war-outcomes/4729B2B926904616190DC38DB3240C8F> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/S0020818315000089> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/656629824219119617/unknown.png

^ example 1: ```[1991-6:] In 1991 Chechnya's first president, Dzhokar Dudayev, took the additional step of declaring independence. Federal forces invaded Chechnya in December 1994 to reestablish control in the breakaway republic. For the next twenty months, Russian federal forces battled Chechen guerrillas in an asymmetric war based in Chechnya.``````From the onset of military operations until the cease-fire in August 1996, some 70 percent of Russians opposed the war.61 Disdain for the war manifested itself most clearly in public attitudes toward Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Opinion polls rated his approval at only 3 percent, just a few points lower than the Russian public's support for Yeltsin's handling of the Chechen problem in general.6``````[1999-on:] A large bomb was detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast Moscow, killing 94 civilians. On September 13, another large bomb blew up an apartment building on the Kashmirskoye highway, killing 118 civilians. On September 16, a truck bomb exploded outside a nine-story apartment complex in the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, killing 17 civilians. The Kremlin quickly fingered the Chechens as the perpetrators.7``````Polls conducted after the terrorist attacks showed that Russians were almost twice as likely to believe that Chechen motives were now to "kill Russians," "bring Russia to its knees," "destabilize the situation in Russia," "destroy and frighten Russian society," and "bring chaos to Russian society" than to achieve "the independence of Chechnya."77``````Popular support for war remained remarkably stable after the bombings; six months after they occurred, 73 percent of Russians favored "the advance of federal forces into Chechnya," compared with only 19 percent of Russians who wanted "peaceful negotiations with the Chechen leadership."83 Since 2000, support for President Putin's Chechnya policy has not dropped below 67 percent.8```
^ example 2: ```The mass uprising in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was an exceptionally moderate period in the history of Palestinian terrorism. The revolt from December 1987 to January 1991 killed only twenty Israeli civilians.``````Edy Kaufman has noted that "the primary purpose of the first intifada was to communicate to Israelis the need to end the occupation of the territories."113 Terrorist acts, even in small numbers, interfered with the message. Throughout the intifada, only 15 percent of Palestinian demonstrations were violent.114 Yet an absolute majority of Israelis (80 percent) believed that the means employed by the Palestinians to protest Israeli rule were "mainly violent." Of the violent Palestinian acts, the vast majority consisted of rock throwing against the Israel Defense Forces in the territories, with few incidences of terrorism inside the Green Line. An even broader consensus of Israelis (93 percent) felt that the intifada was directed "both towards civilians and towards the army."'11``````Compelling evidence suggests, however, that terrorism informed the Israeli view of Palestinian objectives. In a fascinating study based on the polling data contained in the Guttman report, Kaufman observed that the respondents who perceived Palestinian tactics as "mainly violent" were more likely to believe that the Palestinian goal was to "destroy Israel." Conversely, the more Israelis perceived Palestinian tactics as nonviolent, the more they believed the goal was to liberate the territories. The positive correlation between perceived Palestinian terrorism and maximalist objectives existed independent of the respondents' political affiliation, suggesting that the association was not a function of their preexisting political attitudes.11```

[....] [F]rom September 12, 2001 through December 31, 2016, attacks by domestic or “homegrown” violent extremists in the United States resulted in 225 fatalities, according to the ECDB. Of these, 106 were killed by far right violent extremists in 62 separate incidents, and 119 were victims of radical Islamist violent extremists in 23 separate incidents.

Across all experiments, we found no corrections capable of triggering backfire, despite testing precisely the kinds of polarized issues where backfire should be expected. Evidence of factual backfire is far more tenuous than prior research suggests.

metastudy: across 24 longitudinal studies, video game violence was significantly correlated (r=8%, r^2=.6%) with increased physical aggression, controlling for prior aggression and race: <https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/yes-violent-video-games-trigger-aggression-but-debate-lingers/> <https://www.pnas.org/content/115/40/9882.short> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1073/pnas.1611617114> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/565936758970122261/unknown.png ```VGV was related to aggression using both fixed [β = 0.113, 95% CI = (0.098, 0.128)] and random effects models [β = 0.106 (0.078, 0.134)]. When all available covariates were included, the size of the effect remained significant for both models [β = 0.080 (0.065, 0.094) and β = 0.078 (0.053, 0.102), respectively].``````[O]ur metaanalysis yielded a modest effect size of ≈0.11 when additional covariates were not included. Ferguson and his colleagues have noted that a regression coefficient of 0.10 is associated with only 1% of the variance in the outcome and concluded that this is so small as to be meaningless. However, others countered that squared regression coefficients provide a less appropriate metric for judging the practical significance of effects compared with estimates of relative risk.```

conservatives think relationally, not analytically -- just like third worlders: <https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/liberals-are-from-mars-conservatives-are-from-venus/> <http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167214563672> <http://sci-hub.se/10.1177/0146167214563672> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/570350465062273039/10.png Study: Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan summarized cultural differences in psychology and argued that people from one particular culture are outliers: people from societies that are Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD). This study shows that liberals think WEIRDer than conservatives. **In five studies with more than 5,000 participants, we found that liberals think more analytically (an element of WEIRD thought) than moderates and conservatives.** Study 3 replicates this finding in the very different political culture of China, although it held only for people in more modernized urban centers. These results suggest that liberals and conservatives in the same country think as if they were from different cultures. **Studies 4 to 5 show that briefly training people to think analytically causes them to form more liberal opinions, whereas training them to think holistically causes shifts to more conservative opinions.** [....] SciAm: **"Liberals acted more like Westerners, pairing items that belonged to the same abstract category (for instance, two animals), whereas conservatives tended to pair items that were functionally related (monkey and banana), as non-Westerners do. One other classic test of holistic thinking also suggested that liberals tended to use a more typically WEIRD cognitive style."**
low-effort thought increases conservatism and decreases liberalism (or increases it less): <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0146167212439213> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/574281944410619923/unknown.png
right-wing authoritarians are less able to process information, less able to recall information, and less able to make logical inferences from information: <https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5811169>: Three early-state information processing tasks were used: (1) content recognition of a news article 2 minutes after exposure, (2) content recognition of a recorded debate 2 minutes after exposure, and (3) the selection of correct inferential statements about a set of brief paragraphs taken from the Watson and Glasser Critical Thinking Appraisal Test. The experimental setting utilized a computer laboratory with an interactive program that guided and monitored each subject through all phases of the study. As predicted, for both samples, the authoritarianism scores covaried significantly with total cognitive task performance so that as the authoritarianism scores increased cognitive performance decreased. When the acquisition of new material was in written format, authoritarianism interacted with reading skills to limit recognition and retention of new information. When new material was presented orally, in a manner similar to that of a radio or television news broadcast or the giving of testimony during a trial, the task of retaining that information was significantly impacted by authoritarianism (accounting for 13% of the variance in recognition performance by the student sample). Subjects in both student and juror samples who scored high in authoritarianism also made significantly more inferential errors. The data from this study strongly suggests that authoritarianism as a personality variable covaries significantly with a lessened ability of an individual to process incoming information with reasonable care and accuracy.

talk shows disfavor expert opinions; this probably degrades experts as a group: <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15456870309367437> Results of this content analysis revealed several important patterns. The data seem to indicate a multifaceted "leveling" phenomenon in which talk-show experts, intellectual experts in particular, are constructed in such a way that their power is lessened and/or intellectuality is seen as undesirable. [...] More specifically, the social order may be more easily sustained if individuals are apathetic or antagonistic toward most intellectuals, experts, and scholars insofar as these individuals breed critical examination and sometimes even rebellion and revolution. To admire and emulate scholars and intellectuals would more likely entail pressure to examine facts carefully and to search for meaningful, underlying patterns in life. Although some may argue against this elitist interpretation, it nonetheless seems fair to suggest that an electorate and a workforce comprised of such thorough and systematic analysts might be a threat to traditionally established power.

Even in the highly charged pre-election months, everyone outside the Breitbart-centered universe formed a tightly interconnected attention network, with major traditional mass-media and professional sources at the core. The right, by contrast, formed its own insular sphere centered on Breitbart. [....] Outside the rightwing ecosystem, we did not see a leftward polarization but its opposite—an increase in the authority of, and attention paid to, the traditional professional media that occupy the center and center-left, at the expense of the left. On the right, the most important shift was that Fox News reasserted its authority as the central node of the online right-wing media ecosystem. This revival came at the expense of Breitbart, which declined to second place online (leaving aside Fox dominance of conservative television throughout the election and post-election periods). However, Fox News’s resurgence did not increase connections between the right and the rest of the network. During the election, Fox online received 40 percent of its inlinks from the right quintile. In the year after the election, Fox received 51 percent of its links from the right quintile. This shift reflected a decline in linking to Fox across-the-board, not only from the left. Indeed, links from the center-right and the center to Fox declined proportionately more than did links from the center-left and left.8

fox news has an empirical right-shifting effect on people's voting: <https://web.stanford.edu/~ayurukog/cable_news.pdf> <https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/8/16263710/fox-news-presidential-vote-study> [W]e estimate that removing Fox News from cable television during the 2000 election cycle would have reduced the overall Republican presidential vote share by 0.46 percentage points. The predicted effect increases in 2004 and 2008 to 3.59 and 6.34 percentage points, respectively. This increase is driven by increasing viewership on Fox News as well as increasingly conservative slant. Finally, we find that the cable news channels’ potential for influence on election outcomes would be substantially larger were ownership to become more concentrated.
completely false articles made up 2.6 percent of all hard-news articles late in the 2016 campaign: <http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf> In total, articles on proTrump or pro-Clinton fake news websites represented an average of approximately 2.6% of all the articles Americans read on sites focusing on hard news topics during this period. The pro-Trump or pro-Clinton fake news that people read was heavily skewed toward Donald Trump — people saw an average (mean) of 5.45 articles from fake news websites during the study period of October 7–November 14, 2016.

most people (and most young people) have a hard time sifting fact from fiction: <https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:fv751yt5934/SHEG%20Evaluating%20Information%20Online.pdf> [A]t each level -- middle school, high school, and college -- these variations paled in comparison to a stunning and dismaying consistency. Overall, young people's ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak.

# solution: education

# bernie rape essay
full essay image: <https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/young-bernie-sanders-liberty-union-vermont/> <https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bernie-sanders-essay/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/641996786356977674/Man_and_Woman_0.png
full essay part 1: `A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused.
A woman enjoys intercourse with her man -- as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.
The man and woman get dressed up on Sunday -- and go to Church, or maybe to their "revolutionary" political meeting.
Have you ever looked at the Stag, Man, Nero, Tough magazines on the shelf of your local bookstore? Do you know why the newspapers with the articles like "Girl 12 raped by 14 men" sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?
Women, for their own preservation, are trying to pull themselves together. And it's necessary for all of humanity that they do so. Slavishness on one hand breeds pigness on the other hand. Pigness on one hand breeds slavishness on the other. Men and woman -- both are losers. Women adapt themselves to fit the needs of men, and men adapt themselves to fit the needs of women. In the beginning there were strong men who killed the animals and brought home the food -- and the dependent women who cooked it. No more! Only the roles remain -- waiting to be shaken off. There are no human oppressors. Oppressors have lost their humanity. On one hand "slavishness," on the other hand "pigness." Six of one, half dozen of the other. Who wins?
Many women seem to be walking a tightrope now. Their qualities of love, openness, and gentleness were too deeply enmeshed with qualities of dependence, subservience, and masochism. How do you love -- without being dependent? How do you be gentle -- without being subservient? How do you maintain a relationship without giving up your identity and without getting strung out! How do you reach out and give your heart to your lover, but maintain the soul which is you?`
full essay part 2: `And Men. Men are in pain too. They are thinking, wondering. What is it they want from a woman? Are they at fault? Are they perpetrating this man-woman situation? Are they oppressors?
The man is bitter.
"You lied to me, he said. (She did.)
"You said that you loved me, that you wanted me, that you needed me. Those are your words." (They are.)
"But in reality," he said, "If you ever loved me, or wanted me, or needed me (all of which I'm not certain was ever true), you also hated me. You hated me -- just as you have hated every man in your entire life, but you didn't have the guts to tell me that. You hated me before you ever saw me, even though I was not your father, or your teacher, or your sex friend when you were 13 years old, or your husband. You hated me not because of who I am, or what I was to you, but because I am a man. You did not deal with me as a person -- as me. You lived a lie with me, used me and played games with me -- and that's a piggy thing to do."
And she said, "You wanted me not as a woman, or a lover, or a friend, but as a submissive woman, or submissive friend, or submissive lover; and right now where my head is I balk at even the slightest suspicion of that kind of demand."
And he said, "You're full of _______."
And they never again made love together (which they had each liked to do more than anything) or never ever saw each other one more time.`

# berniebros didn't vote for clinton
only 1 in 10 Sanders voters ended up voting for Trump, comparable to switches for other candidates: <https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds> Fully 12 percent of people who voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries voted for President Trump in the general election. [....] Schaffner tells NPR that around 12 percent of Republican primary voters (including 34 percent of Ohio Gov. John Kasich voters and 11 percent of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio voters) ended up voting for Clinton. And according to one 2008 study, around 25 percent of Clinton primary voters in that election ended up voting for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the general. (In addition, the data showed 13 percent of McCain primary voters ended up voting for Obama, and 9 percent of Obama voters ended up voting for McCain — perhaps signaling something that swayed voters between primaries and the general election, or some amount of error in the data, or both.)

<https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-donald-trump-left-13-billion-on-table-2016-03-01> Starting with Trump’s professed net worth of “more than $200 million” in an interview published by The New York Times in November 1976, Griffin says the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITS Index-compounded return would have returned $23.2 billon at the end of 2015, “considerably above Mr. Trump’s recent self-reported net worth of approximately $10 billion.”

# trade policy
each of trump's tariffs increased import prices by between 5% and 25%: <https://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/papers/CEPR-DP13564.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/571381550395031571/unknown.png Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018. We also see similar patterns for foreign countries who have retaliated against the U.S., which indicates that the trade war also reduced real income for other countries.

Opposition eased slightly in 1995, when 62% were against erecting a wall. In 2006, opposition to "building a wall along the border with Mexico" was 56%.

# foreign policy
trump is no pacifist: https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/09/donald-trump-is-dropping-bombs-at-unprecedented-levels/ Judging from Trump’s embrace of the use of air power [...] he is the most hawkish president in modern history. Under Trump, the United States has dropped about 20,650 bombs through July 31, or 80 percent the number dropped under Obama for the entirety of 2016. At this rate, Trump will exceed Obama’s last-year total by Labor Day. In Iraq and Syria, data shows that the United States is dropping bombs at unprecedented levels. In July, the coalition to defeat the Islamic State (read: the United States) dropped 4,313 bombs, 77 percent more than it dropped last July. In June, the number was 4,848 — 1,600 more bombs than were dropped in any one month under President Barack Obama since the anti-ISIS campaign started three years ago. In Afghanistan, the number of weapons released has also shot up since Trump took office. April saw more bombs dropped in the country since the height of Obama’s troop surge in 2012. That was also the month that the United States bombed Afghanistan’s Mamand Valley with the largest non-nuclear bomb ever dropped in combat.

Women seek to gain power by getting control over men. 4. When women lose to men in a fair competition, they typically complain about being discriminated against. **Racism:** 1. White people in the U.S. have certain advantages because of the color of their skin. 2. Racial problems in the U.S. are rare, isolated situations. 3. I am angry that racism exists

Areas with high concentration of Mexican immigrants and import exposure to Mexico and China are actually more likely to favor Hillary another Republican candidate or Hillary Clinton.

The results show mixed evidence that economic distress has motivated Trump support. His supporters are less educated and more likely to work in blue collar occupations, but they earn relatively high household incomes and are no less likely to be unemployed or exposed to competition through trade or immigration. On the other hand, living in racially isolated communities with worse health outcomes, lower social mobility, less social capital, greater reliance on social security income and less reliance on capital income, predicts higher levels of Trump support.** We confirm the theoretical results of our regression analysis using machine learning algorithms and an extensive set of additional variables.

# drone strikes: civilian death rate
drone strikes in Pakistan have a low civilian death rate (Bureau of Investigative Journalism, New America Foundation): <https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a599423.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635315613664935936/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640987066003488828/unknown.png
drone strikes in Pakistan have a low civilian death rate (New American Foundation, Long War Journal, University of Massachusetts DRONE databses): <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26298539.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635313246492033034/unknown.png average 21.37% in 2008, 15.00% in 2009, 2.74% in 2010, 5.68% in 2011
data from press accounts of drone strike deaths, 2004-2010, shows 32% civilian death rate (New America Foundation): <http://chrisherwig.org/data-src/pdf/f2f94dd4-53b7-11e2-b73e-5c969d8d366f-the-year-of-the-drone-newamerica-net.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635319647456985088/unknown.png Our study shows that the 114 reported drone strikes in northwest Pakistan from 2004 to the present have killed between 830 and 1,210 individuals, of whom around 550 to 850 were described as militants in reliable press accounts, about two-thirds of the total on average. Thus, the true civilian fatality rate since 2004 according to our analysis is approximately 32 percent. Averaging the press reports in 2009 indicates that 502 people were killed, 382 of whom were described as militants, for an average civilian fatality rate of 24 percent.

# drone strikes: anti-terrorism efficacy
drone strikes in Pakistan have a positive correlation with terrorism within a week and a negative correlation with terrorism after the first week: <https://academic.oup.com/cesifo/article/64/4/667/4996288> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635326283735367690/ify011f1.png We find that there is little significant impact of drone strikes on Taliban attacks in Afghanistan but that there is a significant impact of drone strikes on Taliban attacks in Pakistan. This impact varies from a positive vengeance effect in the first week following a drone strike to a negative deterrent/incapacitation effect in the second week following a drone strike, when we examine the incidence of terrorist attacks by the Taliban. [....] We find that a terrorist attack in Pakistan is 17.7% less likely to occur 3 days after a successful drone strike. At the same time we find that a terrorist attack is 9.7 and 7.5% more likely to occur five and 6 days after an unsuccessful drone strike, and that a terrorist attack is 7.5 and 8.7% less likely to occur 12 and 13 days after an unsuccessful drone strike. There are 0.283 fewer terrorist attacks in Pakistan 15 days after a successful drone strike, 0.099 more terrorist attacks in Pakistan 6 days after an unsuccessful drone strike, and 0.121 fewer terrorist attacks in Pakistan 12 days after an unsuccessful drone strike (all else constant). These effects are statistically significant. Because all of the statistically significant coefficients on successful drone strikes are negative, it appears that there is an incapacitation effect of the Taliban due to a lost militant leader.

Similarly, the proportion for NIACS comes out at 0.042999938 and for the Independent party at 0.031999985. But whilst Gelman's argument provides evidence that the published counts were fabricated, he admits that it does not preclude the theory that those numbers could have been generated retrospectively (and unprofessionally) from valid percentages. The proportion reported for turnout, 0.734237287, does not exhibit the unusual property found in the vote counts.

# chemical attacks
Confirmed: 2013 Khan al-Assal (Syrian government), 2013 Ghouta (Syrian government)

Syrian government: 19 March 2013 Khan al-Assal: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (numerous eyewitness reports) but could not obtain environmental or blood samples and could not evaluate munitions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_al-Assal_chemical_attack> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> Due to the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit to Khan Al Asal and therefore was not in a position to collect primary evidence relating to the number or type of munitions and/or delivery system that was used in the incident. [....] Due to the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit to Khan Al Asal and therefore was not in a position to collect environmental samples. In addition, six months following the incident, the probative value of such samples would be negligible. The Russian Federation presented the United Nations Mission with its own report relying on environmental samples collected by a Russian investigation team, which found remainders of Sarin. The United Nations Mission studied the report but could not independently verify the chain of custody for the sampling and the transport of the samples. [....] The United Nations Mission applied the standards for epidemiologic determination of cause-and-effect and assessed that an organophosphorous intoxication was the cause of the rapidly onsetting mass intoxication taking place on the morning of the 19 March 2013. Based on its interviews and the assessment of the medical records obtained from five hospitals receiving the alleged victims, the United Nations Mission did not determine any alternative explanations for the symptoms.
Unknown: 13 April 2013 Sheikh Maqsood: UN could not obtain environmental or blood samples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War_(January%E2%80%93April_2013)#13_April> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission sought to conduct fact-finding activities pertaining to this incident from the territory of a bordering country, having determined that such an investigation held the prospect of producing additional information. The United Nations Mission was ultimately unable to obtain any such information.
Unknown: 29 April 2013 Saraqueb: UN could not obtain environmental or blood samples: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraqib_chemical_attack> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit and therefore was not able to collect any environmental samples. The French Government presented a report containing results of environmental samples testing positive for Sarin. The United Nations Mission studied the report but could not independently verify the chain of custody for the sampling and the transport of the samples.
Syrian government: 21 August 2013 Ghouta: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (environmental samples 2x, blood samples, eyewitness reports) from surface-to-surface rockets with sufficient quality that the perpetrator must have had access to the Syrian military's chemical weapons stockpile: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack> <https://undocs.org/A/67/997> [O]n 21 August 2013, chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic, also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale. In particular, the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent Sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus. [....] Close to the rocket impact sites, in the area where patients were affected, the environment was found to be contaminated by Sarin. <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The final laboratory results on environmental samples from Ghouta (Moadamiyah and Zamalka) are published below (see table 5.1). The results further support the conclusion of the earlier report (A/67/997-S/2013/553), improving the consistency between the results of the two laboratories. <https://www.refworld.org/docid/53182eed4.html> The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military, as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents. Concerning the incident in Khan Al-Assal on 19 March, the chemical agents used in that attack bore the same unique hallmarks as those used in Al-Ghouta.
Not chemical weapons: 22 August 2013 Bahhariyeh: UN found sufficient evidence against chemical weapon use (blood samples): <https://undocs.org/A/67/997> The United Nations Mission was not able to conduct an on-site visit and was therefore not able to collect any environmental samples. [....] Blood and urine samples were collected from the most severely intoxicated patients. The analysis results tested negative for any of the chemical warfare agents.
Unknown: 24 August 2013 Jobar: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (blood samples x2, eyewitness reports) but could not evaluate munitions: While the United Nations Mission visited the site, it found the site to have been corrupted by mine-clearing activities. As such, there was no probative value in collecting samples. The Syrian Government allegedly recovered soil samples from the impact site that tested positive for Sarin. The United Nations Mission could not verify the chain of custody for this sampling and subsequent analysis. [....] The United Nations Mission was given four samples reportedly withdrawn by the Syrian Government on 24 August 2013 upon the victims’ arrival to the hospital, which were all positive for Sarin exposure. The United Nations Mission collected four blood samples on 28 September 2013, one of which tested positive for Sarin exposure. All samples were subjected to DNA testing to confirm the origin of the presented whole blood samples. The analyses confirmed that the four samples provided by the Syrian Government matched those of the four alleged victims interviewed and sampled. The medical records received from Martyr Yusuf Al Azmah Military Hospital provided corroborating evidence of cholinesterase inhibition indicating Sarin exposure in two of the four patients.
Unknown: 25 August 2013 Ashrafiah Sahnaya: UN found sufficient evidence for sarin use (blood samples x2) but could not evaluate munitions: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_to_Investigate_Alleged_Uses_of_Chemical_Weapons_in_the_Syrian_Arab_Republic> <https://undocs.org/A/68/663> The United Nations Mission did not visit the site of the alleged incident and was therefore not in a position to collect primary information concerning the munitions. According to witnesses, a catapult allegedly threw unidentified objects aiming at the military checkpoint. [....] The United Nations Mission did not visit the site of the alleged incident and was therefore not in a position to collect environmental samples. [....] On 29 September 2013, the United Nations Mission was given five samples allegedly drawn by the Syrian Government on 25 August 2013 upon the arrival of the patients at the hospital. The United Nations Mission drew its own blood samples on 26 and 28 September 2013. 107. All samples were subjected to DNA testing to confirm the origin of the presented whole blood samples. The analyses confirmed that the samples provided by the Syrian Government matched those of the alleged victims interviewed and sampled. The five blood samples drawn on 25 August 2013 all tested positive for Sarin exposure, whereas those drawn on 26 and 28 September tested negative.

claims of ethnic cleansing are false, according to the United Nations: http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/14032017

the most that Amnesty International can allege against Rojava (a state of 6 million in a 4-year war against ISIS, Syria, and Turkey) are: one forced population movement, one unjustified bulldozing of a village, several unjustified arrests of journalists, and incomplete due process in the courts:

# 9/11 and the axis of evil
George Bush, 29 January 2002, includes Iraq in the axis of evil that will export terror like 9/11: <https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-22> **Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th, but we know their true nature.** North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens. Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom. **Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens, leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections, then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.** States like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.
George Bush, 07 October 2002, alleges Iraq could harbor Al-Qaeda in the future: <https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021007-8.html> We know that Iraq and the al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy -- the United States of America. We know that Iraq and al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade. Some al Qaeda leaders who fled Afghanistan went to Iraq. These include one very senior al Qaeda leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year, and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks. We've learned that Iraq has trained al Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September the 11th, Saddam Hussein's regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America. Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists. Alliance with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack America without leaving any fingerprints. Some have argued that confronting the threat from Iraq could detract from the war against terror. To the contrary; confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on terror. When I spoke to Congress more than a year ago, I said that those who harbor terrorists are as guilty as the terrorists themselves. Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, the instruments of mass death and destruction. And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.

<https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB254/index.htm> The documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis, which then conformed to public positions taken by Pentagon and White House officials. For example, a July 2002 draft of the "White Paper" ultimately issued by the CIA in October 2002 actually pre-dated the National Intelligence Estimate that the paper purportedly summarized, but which Congress did not insist on until September 2002.

PIS is Poland's conservative party:
PIS is seizing control of the state media: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/poland-president-signs-bill-putting-state-media-under-government-control>: Poland’s president has signed into law a bill handing the conservative government control of state media, despite concern elsewhere in the EU and condemnation from rights watchdogs. [....] Under the new law, senior figures in public radio and television will be appointed – and sacked – by the treasury minister, and will no longer be hired by the National Broadcasting Council. Under the legislation current managers and supervisory board members of Poland’s public broadcasters will be fired with immediate effect.
PIS is seizing control of the independent judiciary: <https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-20/poland-steps-away-democracy-and-eu-latest-judiciary-reforms>: Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, which is controlled by the ruling far-right Law and Justice Party (PiS), have passed a bill that would force 83 of the nation’s top judges to resign and will give the governing party control over who replaces them. In Poland, the Supreme Court is not only the final court of appeal for all criminal and civil cases, but also the body that rules on the validity of elections — which is exactly what concerns the EU and political opponents.
PIS is trying to ban *all* abortions, even for safety: <https://jacobinmag.com/2018/03/poland-black-protests-womens-strike-abortion-pis>: It wasn’t until 2016, when the right-wing Law and Justice Party (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, introduced a bill that would have made abortion completely illegal that the women’s movement was able to break out of this isolation. Abortion is legal in Poland only in three cases: when pregnancy is the result of rape, when the fetus shows risks of severe damage or illness, and when the life of the woman is endangered. Unfortunately, even under these conditions women often do not obtain permission to terminate pregnancies, which leads them either to illegal abortions, in Poland or abroad, or to face serious risks to give birth anyways. Official statistics count only around 100 legal abortions per year in Poland; but, according to feminist organizations, some 140,000 illegal ones are additionally carried out. The PiS bill would have made abortion illegal even in these exceptional cases. Additionally, it would have criminalized not only women who sought abortions, but their doctors and anyone else who assisted them, allowing them to be sentenced to up to two years of jail time.
PIS is trying to criminalize discussion of Poland's part in the Holocaust: <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/poland-antisemitism-nationalism-holocaust>: Under the guise of defending the good name of “The Polish Nation” the bill opens the way to criminalising anyone who seeks to reveal dark chapters of Polish history, such as antisemitic pogroms before, during and after the war. But this is a veneer. What is truly at stake is not Poland’s reputation, but Polish nationalist rightwing tradition. The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) makes no secret of the fact that it is part of this tradition. The language and ideas of PiS leaders, as well as their policies towards refugees, minorities and political opposition, draw directly from the rhetoric and strategy of Polish nationalism in the first half of the 20th century. [It's already been used for this purpose: <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/05/polish-group-files-suit-against-argentina-newspaper-over-holocaust-story> ]
PIS supported thousands of far-right marchers with racist slogans under falangist banners: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/12/white-europe-60000-nationalists-march-on-polands-independence-day: Tens of thousands of nationalist demonstrators marched through Warsaw at the weekend to mark Poland’s independence day, throwing red-smoke bombs and carrying banners with slogans such as “white Europe of brotherly nations”. Police estimated 60,000 people took part in Saturday’s event, in what experts say was one of the biggest gathering of far-right activists in Europe in recent years. Demonstrators with faces covered chanted “Pure Poland, white Poland!” and “Refugees get out!” [....] TVP, which reflects the conservative government’s line, called it a “great march of patriots”, and in its broadcasts described the event as one that drew mostly ordinary Poles expressing their love of Poland, not extremists.

the Israeli documents did not show that Iran was actively breaking the nuclear deal; they merely confirmed existence of a secret nuclear program that ended in 2004: <https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/281346.htm> <https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/netanyahu-s-info-iran-nukes-known-u-s-intelligence-years-n870456> <https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/papers-stolen-in-a-daring-israeli-raid-on-tehran-archive-reveal-the-extent-of-irans-past-weapons-research/2018/07/15/0f7911c8-877c-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html> [Secretary of State Michael Pompeo:] The existence of the AMAD program that ended roughly December of 2003, January of 2004, it is accurate to say that the knowledge of that has been known for – the fact of that had been known for quite some time. But there are thousands of new documents and new information. We’re still going through it. There’s still a lot of work to do to figure out precisely the scope and scale of it. But it is the case – it – there is new information about that program.

This resolution did not pass.[165][166] Ultimately, a resolution of disapproval was brought to the Senate floor, but failed. A resolution of approval was brought to the House floor, but it, too, failed. As a result, the agreement went into effect following congressional review period.[167]

Most of the increased revenue was a result of the nationalization and associated policy changes, including a doubling of production by 2013. 9

However, between 2015 and 2018, the average annual budget deficit grew to 7.5 percent of GDP; on average, 4.3 percentage points of the deficit were financed internally by the Central Bank.26 From 2005 to 2017, the Bolivian government increased social spending by 80 percent in real terms.

[....] Bolivia’s government has directed large amounts of resources to social spending, especially cash transfers targeted toward vulnerable sectors of the population. The three most important transfer programs are Juancito Pinto, a grant to families with children that is designed to incentivize children’s school attendance; Juana Azurduy, which gives funds to uninsured new mothers as an incentive for them to seek medical care during and after their pregnancies, in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality; and Renta Dignidad, which provides grants for those over the age of 60. These cash transfer programs translate into increased consumer spending and sustained reduction of extreme poverty. In 2018, 5.8 million Bolivians — 51.8 percent of the population — received a direct government cash transfer.29 [....] However, it is arguable that the government could have done even more for the poor. As a percent of GDP, social spending actually decreased between 2005 and 2013, though it has since risen to 12.7 percent of GDP, up from 12.4 percent of GDP in 2005.30

# not socialist: investment
<https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/the-tragedy-of-venezuela/> What went wrong with the laudable aims of Chavismo? Could this tragedy been avoided? Well, yes, if the Chavista revolution had not stopped at less than halfway, leaving the economy still predominantly in the control of capital. Instead, the Chavista and Maduro governments relied on high oil prices and huge oil reserves to reduce poverty, while failing to transform the economy through productive investment, state ownership and planning. Between 1999 and 2012 the state had an income of $383bn from oil, due not only to the improvement in prices, but also to the increase in the royalties paid by the transnationals. However, this income was not used transform the productive sectors of the economy. Yes, some was used to improve the living standards of the most impoverished masses. But there was no plan for investment and growth. Venezuelan capital was allowed to get on with it – or not as the case may be. Indeed, the share of industry in GDP fell from 18% of GDP in 1998 to 14% in 2012.

# food
report: <http://cepr.net/blogs/the-americas-blog/the-media-venezuela-and-hunger-statistics-a-case-study-in-careless-reporting> US newspapers and journals often attribute their Venezuelan hunger figures to “a recent survey … by the country’s leading universities.” The survey in question was published on February 27, 2016 by Simón Bolívar University, the Central University of Venezuela, and the Bengoa Foundation. The report, which focuses on Venezuelan nutrition, is part of an annual review covering the state of living conditions in the country. Maritza Landaeta-Jiménez, who as recently as 2013 was a member of the Venezuelan opposition’s Nutrition Commission, headed the 2016 research. **The document, based on a survey of 6,413 Venezuelans, reported that 93 percent of Venezuelans felt that they did not have enough money to purchase food, and that 72.7 percent of Venezuelans had lost an average of 8.7 kilograms (19 pounds) in the past year. However, the same survey revealed that 67.5 percent of Venezuelans were eating three meals a day, and only 25 percent of the country felt that their nutrition could be categorized as “deficient.”**
shortages: <https://nacla.org/news/2016/11/03/hunger-venezuela-look-beyond-headlines> When Venezuelan economist and Universidad Simón Bolívar professor Pasqualina Curcio put these claims to the test in her extensive investigation of the country’s current economic situation, she had some interesting findings. First, several of the missing products have not been regulated since 2010, and among those that are regulated, the government has raised prices in an effort to incentivize distributors several times recently, but this has not resulted in increased availability. Second, the shortages began to intensify in 2013, before oil prices plummeted and while dollars were still readily available. Even once oil prices dropped and dollars became less available, the government continued to prioritize dollars for food import, and by their own accounting, the production levels of Venezuela’s major food companies have been stable or have even increased in that time. Curcio also found a correlation between intensity of food shortages and politically important moments, such as the lead-up to elections. Could it be that the shortages are manufactured? Many food sovereignty activists see it as no coincidence that Polar, the country’s largest food company, responsible for many of the items missing from shelves, is owned by a well-known member of the political opposition to the government.

food balance sheets data: http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CC
food security methodology: <http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/fs-methods/fs-methods1/en/> Parameters to characterize the distribution of food consumption employed to estimate the PoU are derived from different sources. To compute per mean or per capita DEC at a national level, FAO relies on Food Balance Sheets. The latest data from this source refer to 2011; therefore, additional sources were needed to estimate the DEC for the last 3 years, from 2012-14. The main source for 2012 and 2013 estimates were projections prepared by the Trade and Market Division of FAO. The Holt-Winters distributed lag model was instead used to project the DEC for 2014. In some cases, the same model was applied to compute projections also for 2012 and 2013, when data from the Trade and Market Division were not available. The Holt-Winters model uses a process known as exponential smoothing, which attributes higher weights to the more recent data and progressively less weight to the older observations. Weights decrease in each period by a constant amount, which lies on an exponential curve. For countries showing peculiar patterns, other simpler forecasting models were used, such as linear or exponential trends.
food balance methodology: http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/X9892E/X9892e01.htm#P78_13383 Food balance sheets are assembled form a variety of sources. The quality of the balance sheets and their coverage vary considerably among countries and commodities. Inaccuracies and errors may be introduced at each stage of a balance sheet's construction. The user of these data must therefore bear in mind their limitations. Ideally, the basic data required for the preparation of food balance sheets should be obtained from the same source. This implies that, firstly, the country should have a comprehensive statistical system which records all current information relating to each component of the food balance sheet (starting from producers to consumers). Secondly, concepts of the information adopted should be those of the food balance sheet concepts. Thirdly, the information available should be consistent, at least with respect to measurement unit and time reference period. In practice, however, such an ideal statistical system does not exist. Even in the few, mainly developed, countries which possess uncommonly sophisticated reporting procedures, the available data do not always meet either the second or third condition. Therefore, in practice, the basic data are necessarily based on a large variety of sources. The main sources commonly used are discussed below. Production and trade data are part of the ongoing national official statistics. They are based either on direct enquiries or records, or are estimated by Government agencies. Information on stock changes is available from marketing authorities and factories or from farmer stock surveys. Information on industrial uses are obtained from industrial/manufacturing censuses/surveys. Feed and seeding rates are obtained from cost of production surveys or are estimated by the Government agencies concerned. Losses occurring in industrial processing are also obtained from manufacturing surveys.

Problems were reported in only 16 of 252 voting sites visited, and most of these would not affect the results of the elections. The delegates found voters, poll workers, party witnesses, and soldiers worked together harmoniously to make this a transparent and peaceful election that clearly reflected the will of the Venezuelan people.

We are extremely impressed with citizens´ desire to exercise their right to vote and commend them on their patience and peacefulness. Our delegates found political party witnesses in almost all voting sites, representing a variety of parties at the national and local levels. In addition, the voting table workers had the basic knowledge necessary, worked diligently to instruct the voters on properly completing the ballots, and strived to overcome the difficulties of this complicated election process.

2007 constitutional referendum, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela_120307.html> Venezuelan citizens responded on Dec. 2 in a peaceful and orderly way to the referendum convoked by the National Electoral Council (CNE) to approve or reject the proposal to reform the National Constitution, presented to the citizens by the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. With 90 percent of the vote counted, the CNE declared the referendum defeated, and immediately thereafter President Hugo Chávez Frías accepted the results on national television.

2012 Presidential election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-2012-election-study-mission-final-rpt.pdf> The 2012 presidential elections in Venezuela won by Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías reflected and reinforced the intense political contestation and social polarization Venezuelans have grown accustomed to since Chávez was first elected to the presidency in December 1998. Fortunately, tensions did not boil over and voting took place peacefully amid the high stakes election on Oct. 7, 2012. [....] Even so, isolated claims of fraud surfaced after the vote. Nevertheless, the whole opposition leadership, including, most importantly, Capriles himself, unequivocally rejected those claims, stating that the results reflected the will of the electorate. [....] Because the Center did not have an election observation mission in Venezuela, this report is not a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the electoral process as a whole. The report is based on the interviews conducted, the reports of national observer organizations, an analysis of Venezuelan laws and regulations, and a digest of personal observations from a nine-month monitoring period.
2013 Presidential election: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Venezuelan_presidential_election>
2013 Presidential election, Carter Center: <https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/venezuela-070313.html> <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-final-rpt-2013-elections.pdf> As the high turnout and many opinion polls demonstrate, the Venezuelan population, and the political parties and candidates in gene	ral, have confidence in the performance and integrity of the automated touch-screen voting machines. As the postelection citizen verification audits of 100 percent of the voting machines demonstrated, the automated system functioned as expected in recording the votes cast, transmitting, and counting them on April 14. There was not agreement, however, about the quality of the voting conditions and guarantees that every registered voter is able to vote one time, and only one time. In stark comparison to the October election, when the Capriles campaign and the MUD opposition coalition questioned the conditions of competition, after the April election they also questioned the conditions of voting, a heightened criticism that went to the heart of the system’s legitimacy.

Jimmy Carter, 2012: <http://web.archive.org/web/20120923221123/http://cartercenter.org/news/multimedia/Conversations/30-years-of-the-carter-center.html> https://youtu.be/VPKPw4t6Sic?t=2629 Some of the problems that John mentioned are serious, but I think the elections in Venezuela;  although some people have criticized the result, which is Hugo Chavez having won. There is no doubt in my mind, having monitored very closely the election process, that he won fairly and squarely.  As a matter of fact, of the 92 elections we've monitored, I would say the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.

# media
from 2000 to 2010, government media averaged just 3% audience share: <http://cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf> As can be seen from the table, as of September 2010, Venezuelan state TV channels had just a 5.4 percent audience share. Of the other 94.6 percent of the audience, 61.4 percent were watching privately owned television channels, and 33.1 percent were watching paid TV. Since the private TV owners are mostly against the government, it is clear that more than 94 percent of the TV that is seen by Venezuelans is not progovernment. In fact, much of the private media is stridently antigovernment, in ways that go beyond the boundaries of what is permitted in the United States, for example. There are no data that describe the breakdown of audience share of the various TV channels on the basis of political bias. However, it is clear from this data, based on household surveys over a 10-year period, that statements about the Venezuelan government “controlling” or “dominating” the media are not only exaggerated, but simply false.
in the 2013 election, the opposition candidate Capriles routinely received more airtime than Maduro: <https://www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/news/peace_publications/election_reports/venezuela-final-rpt-2013-elections.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/547505802416619521/unknown.png

# fascists weren't socialists
#####o
# But weren't the Nazis the National **Socialist** German **Workers'** Party?
Yes. However, as he stated in this 1938 speech, Hitler was **explicitly** not a socialist in the "economically left and socially left" sense ( <https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ&q=Our+adopted+term+%27Socialist%27+has+nothing+to+do+with+Marxian+Socialism.+Marxism+is+anti-property;+true+Socialism+is+not> ): 'Socialist' I define from the word 'social; meaning in the main ‘social equity’. A Socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his personal efficiency. **Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxian Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true socialism is not.** Marxism places no value on the individual, or individual effort, of efficiency; true Socialism values the individual and encourages him in individual efficiency, at the same time holding that his interests as an individual must be in consonance with those of the community. All great inventions, discoveries, achievements were first the product of an individual brain. It is charged against me that I am against property, that I am an atheist. Both charges are false.

Yes. However, as he stated in this 1935 speech, Hitler saw many differences between his ideology and the USSR's: ( <https://books.google.com/books?id=r_-htwAACAAJ&dq=hitler+may+21+1935+speech> ):
* National Socialism is a doctrine that has reference exclusively to the German people. Bolshevism lays stress on international mission. [....]
* National Socialism fights for the reconciliation and consequent adjustment of the differences in life and the union of all for common benefits. Bolshevism teaches the overcoming of an alleged class rule by the dictatorship of the power of a different class. [....]
* As National Socialists, our hearts are full with admiration and respect for the great achievements of the past, not only in our own people but also far beyond. We are happy to belong to an European cultural community that has so tremendously embossed today's world with a stamp of its mind. Bolshevism rejects this cultural achievement of mankind, claiming that has found the beginning of the real cultural and human history in the year of birth of Marxism.
* We, National Socialists, do not want to be of the same opinion as our church organizations in this or that organizational question. But we never want a lack of belief in religion or any faith, and do not wish that our churches become club-houses or cinemas. Bolshevism teaches the godlessness and acts accordingly.
* We National Socialists see in private property a higher level of human economic development that according to the differences in performance controls the management of what has been accomplished enabling and guaranteeing the advantage of a higher standard of living for everyone. Bolshevism destroys not only private property but also private initiative and the readiness to shoulder responsibility.

# But didn't the Nazis seize control of industry?
Yes and no. The Nazis arose during the Great Depression. During this time, **all** Western nations (including the Nazis) used some nationalization and regulation to stablize their economies and later to prepare for war. However, the Nazis **privatized** previously-nationalized industries. (In fact, the term "privatization" was coined to describe Nazi economic policies <http://www.ub.edu/graap/JEP.pdf>.) As Germa Bel writes: <http://www.ub.edu/gim/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/EHR_bel.pdf>: "The Great Depression spurred State ownership in Western capitalist countries. Germany was no exception; the last governments of the Weimar Republic took over firms in diverse sectors. **Later, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in the Western capitalist countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s.** Privatization in Nazi Germany was also unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public services previously provided by government. The firms and the services transferred to private ownership belonged to diverse sectors. **Privatization was part of an intentional policy with multiple objectives and was not ideologically driven.** As in many recent privatizations, particularly within the European Union, strong financial restrictions were a central motivation. In addition, privatization was used as a political tool to enhance support for the government and for the Nazi Party."

# But didn't the Fascists seize control of industry?
No. In fact, Fascist Italy engaged in the first large-scale privatization in modern Western history: As Germa Bel writes: <http://www.ub.edu/graap/bel_Italy_fascist.pdf> "Italy’s first Fascist government applied a large-scale privatization policy between 1922 and 1925. The government privatized the state monopoly of match sale, eliminated the State monopoly on life insurances, sold most of the State-owned telephone networks and services to private firms, reprivatized the largest metal machinery producer, and awarded concessions to private firms to build and operate motorways. These interventions represent one of the earliest and most decisive privatization episodes in the Western world. While ideological considerations may have had a certain influence, privatization was used mainly as a political tool to build confidence among industrialists and to increase support for the government and the Partito Nazionale Fascista. Privatization also contributed to balancing the budget, which was the core objective of Fascist economic policy in its first phase."

# But didn't the Nazis control industry indirectly and destroy private property?
Yes and no. The Nazis arose during the Great Depression. During this time, **all** Western nations (including the Nazis) used some nationalization and regulation to stablize their economies and later to prepare for war. However, the Nazis believed that private businesses were more efficient than state planning. Thus, business was heavily involved in the Nazis' planning processes <https://libcom.org/files/Daniel%20Guerin-Fascism%20and%20Big%20Business-Pathfinder%20Press%20(2000).pdf> and private property and the profit motive both remained solidly intact, as Buchheim and Scherner write: ( <http://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Workshops-Seminars/Economic-History/buchheim-041020.pdf>): "Private property in the industry of the Third Reich is often considered a mere nominal provision without much substance. However, that is not correct, because **firms, despite the rationing and licensing activities of the state, still had ample scope to devise their own production and investment profiles.** Even regarding war-related projects, freedom of contract was generally respected; instead of using power, the state offered firms a number of contract options to choose from. **There were several motives behind this attitude of the regime, among them the conviction that private property provided important incentives for increasing efficiency.**"

# But didn't the Nazis set official wages?
Yes and no. Prior to the Nazis, the Weimar Republic (under socialist influence) created collective wage agreements across industries in hopes of preventing "cut-throat" competition for labor. In contrast, the Nazi official wage rates were far lower than Weimar wage rates, could be overruled (allowing lower pay) for individual companies by the DAF's "labor trustees", and disallowed the possibility of collective bargaining by the workers. <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003232928501400101>

# But didn't the Nazis create the "Labor Front"?
Yes. The Nazis established the German Labour Front (Deutsche Arbeitsfront, DAF). To establish the DAF, the Nazis destroyed non-DAF trade unions as "leftist" and seized their funds <https://www.teachers.org.uk/files/trade-unionists-leaflet.pdf>. In name, the DAF was intended to mediate conflicts between businessowners and workers. In practice, the Nazis used the DAF to decrease the worker power and to trap workers in their current place of employment, as William Shirer notes: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT449#v=onepage&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561310446171324425/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561313705271230473/unknown.png

# But didn't the Nazis create "Strength through Joy", Kraft durch Freude?
Yes. KdF was a large vacation program established to sell the working class on Nazism and to boost German tourism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_Through_Joy>; in practice, it was heavily involved in regimenting the leisure time of workers towards Nazi goals rather than allowing them freedom: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT453#v=onepage&q&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/561314617423298580/unknown.png

# But didn't the Nazis create the "Peoples Car", Volkswagen?
As Willaim Shirer notes, Volkswagen was a Nazi swindle: <https://books.google.com/books?id=fpFbuCKOLKwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT456#v=onepage&f=false> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640987769920815124/unknown.png

# But didn't the Nazis and the socialists both use red?
The Nazi flag colors (black, white, red) come from the imperial German flag colors (black, white, red). For example, the nationalist imperial German propaganda song "Stolz weht die Flagge schwarz-weiß-rot" (The Flag Proudly Waves Black-White-Red) <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolz_weht_die_Flagge_schwarz-wei%C3%9F-rot> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIs3S6ckTmw> was explicitly mirrored in Nazi propaganda song "Deutschland du Land der Treue" in the lines "Hakenkreuzfahnen schwarz, weiss, und rot" (Swastika flags black, white, and red) <http://soldatenlieder.blogspot.com/2012/03/deutschland-du-land-der-treue-heil.html> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cvvFm2Vi6M>. Moreover, the use of red in Nazi propaganda was an intentional anti-left tactic, as Hitler stated in Mein Kampf, 1922, Book 2 Vol 2 p. 270: <http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv2ch07.html> "We chose red for our posters after particular and careful deliberation, our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come to our meetings -- if only in order to break them up -- so that in this way we got a chance of talking to the people."

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_People%27s_Welfare> In three budgetary years, the funds required by Germany's social welfare programs had more than doubled from 640.4 million Reichmarks in 1938 to 1.395 billion Reichmarks by 1941.[12]

# fascist italy: capitalist winners, labor losers
italy reduced wages (and utterly failed to replicate FDR's success): <http://www.gustavopiga.it/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PaperGiordanoPigaTrovato_November2011.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/570334413787889677/unknown.png President Roosevelt, as well as raising prices to favor industrialists, also increased workers’ bargaining power and, therefore, their wages. The Fascist government, on the contrary, being more attentive to industrialists’ concerns, on the one hand fought the drop in consumer prices, but on the other, abolished most of the workers’ bargaining power and intervened systematically in cutting wages.

5.4 million, Timothy Snyder (PhD historian, author of Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_D._Snyder> <https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/> <https://books.google.com/books?id=maEfAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false> Overall, the Germans, with much local assistance, deliberately murdered about 5.4 million Jews, roughly 2.6 million by shooting and 2.8 million by gassing (about a million at Auschwitz, 780,863 at Treblinka, 434,508 at Bełzec, about 180,000 at Sobibór, 150,000 at Chełmno, 59,000 at Majdanek, and many of the rest in gas vans in occupied Serbia and the occupied Soviet Union). A few hundred thousand more Jews died during deportations to ghettos or of hunger or disease in ghettos. Another 300,000 Jews were murdered by Germany’s ally Romania. Most Holocaust victims had been Polish or Soviet citizens before the war (3.2 million and 1 million respectively). The Germans also killed more than a hundred thousand Roma.
5.29–6.2 million, Wolfgang Benz (PhD historian, author of Dimension des Völkermords: Die Zahl der jüdischen Opfer des Nationalsozialismus and The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide): <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Benz> <https://books.google.com/books?id=a0ePJCotH0UC&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false> The number of victims—and with certainty the following represent the minimum number in each case—cannot express that adequately. Numbers are just too abstract. However they must be stated in order to make clear the dimension of the genocide: 165,000 Jews from Germany, 65,000 from Austria, 32,000 from France and Belgium, more than 100,000 from the Netherlands, 60,000 from Greece, the same number from Yugoslavia, more than 140,000 from Czechoslovakia, half a million from Hungary, 2.2 million from the Soviet Union, and 2.7 million from Poland. To these numbers must be added all those killed in the pogroms and massacres in Romania and Transitrien (over 200,000) and the deported and murdered Jews from Albania and Norway, Denmark and Italy, from Luxembourg and Bulgaria.

<https://amp.livescience.com/44443-treblinka-archaeological-excavation.html> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207418300189> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/566328111348842525/unknown.png To address this issue, an historical and archaeological project began at Treblinka in 2007. Staff from the Centre of Archaeology undertook non-invasive fieldwork at both Treblinka I and II in 2010, 2012 and 2013 in order to identify the locations of the camp boundaries, mass graves and gas chambers; aims that were successfully achieved [2], [3], [12]. This work involved walkover survey, topographic survey (with DGPS and a Total Station) and geophysical survey. Excavations were also undertaken in 2013 which confirmed the location of one of the gas chamber buildings and identified a number of personal belongings. During this fieldwork season, and a subsequent season in 2017, the methodology described below was employed in order to further characterize the terrain of, and evidence contained within, both camps.
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10761-017-0432-3> The excavation of Trench 4 confirmed that the 22 × 15 m anomaly in the GPR results did in fact represent the foundations of the first gas chambers built by the Nazis at Treblinka (known as the old gas chambers), which existed at a depth of 0.85 m below the ground. [....] Dentures, and gold and silver teeth were also found along with a considerable amount of fragmented human remains, some of which exhibited evidence of burning and some that did not. All of these different types of material traces were commingled, confirming the nature of destruction afforded to the gas chambers in autumn 1943 and the heavily disturbed nature of the ground exhibited in the GPR results.

in total, the Nazis received about $143-430 billion in assets alone from the extermination of the Jews: <http://jcpa.org/article/restitution-of-holocaust-era-assets-promises-and-reality/>

<https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4vgeki/marxist_historical_analyses_of_the_holocaust/d5zgkqz/> The historical understanding of Nazism and the Holocaust as »accidents of history« or part of a totalitarian trend averse to liberal, capitalist development are part of hegemonic discourse of portraying the current capitalist order as the best possible of all worlds and thus making them out to be the natural and unimporvable state of things often, consciously or unconsciously, aimed at squashing any kind of resistance against Capitalist hegemony. Understanding Nazism and the Holocaust as linked to factors inherent in capitalism – racism, colonialism, imperialism – is act of challenging the hegemony on the basis of its historical narrative. By historically rigorously pointing to these explicit links, a direct or indirect critique of the status quo, which in its most extreme forms can bring forward the catastrophe of Nazism, the hegemonic narrative is challenged and a blow of resistance is delivered.
<https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4tln3x/steve_king_the_contributions_of_western_civ/d5ko61i/> Within historiography of the subject, the interesting thing to see is that the first two I mentioned are pretty much dead as of now and nobody would use them anymore. Generational and paradigm shifts as well as careful examination of the evidence have left us with only the latter two that understand Nazism as a product of modernity rather than it aberration or it being outside of modernity. Totalitarianism also doesn't hold up to historical examination, which leaves us with a variation of the last explanation, which is also in my opinion the most convincing.

# too many bodies
the central office of Auschwitz-Birkenau asserts they could cremate, per day, 340 persons in crematorium 1, 1440 persons in crematorium 2, 1440 persons in crematorium 3, 768 persons in crematorium 4, 768 persons in crematorium 5, which totals to 4765 persons per day, 1,737,129 persons per year, and 4,690,248 persons over Auschwitz-Birkenau's 2.7 years of operation: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab3-german-documents-ovens/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/642017872838918145/Leisung_der_Krematorien_in_24_Stunden_lt.png According to the Zentralbauleitung letter, given the normal pace of cremation (half an hour for two corpses in one retort), each crematorium could incinerate 768 corpses in 24 hours. However, Sonderkommando prisoners testified that up to 1,500 corpses were burned in 24 hours (three to five within 20 to 30 minutes).
the Vrba-Wetzler report (compiled by escapee Slovak Jews) estimates that the crematoria of Auschwitz-Birkenau could handle 6,000 persons per day, 2,190,000 persons per year, and 5,913,000 persons over Auschwitz-Birkenau's 2.7 years of operation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrba%E2%80%93Wetzler_report> <https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-vrba-wetzler-report-auschwitz-protocols> At present there are four crematoria in operation at BIRKENAU, two large ones, I and II, and two smaller ones, III and IV. Those of type I and II consist of 3 parts, i.e.,: (A) the furnace room; (B) the large halls; and (C) the gas chamber. A huge chimney rises from the furnace room around which are grouped nine furnaces, each having four openings. Each opening can take three normal corpses at once and after an hour and a half the bodies are completely burned. This corresponds to a daily capacity of about 2,000 bodies... Crematoria III and IV work on nearly the same principle, but their capacity is only half as large. Thus the total capacity of the four cremating and gassing plants at BIRKENAU amounts to about 6,000 daily.
the instructions written by the cremation company: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ab4-civilian-ovens-comparison/> "As soon as the remains of the bodies have fallen from the chamotte grid to the ash collection channel below, they should be pulled forward towards the ash removal door, using the scraper. Here they can be left for a further twenty minutes to be fully consumed . . . In the meantime, further bodies can be introduced one after the other into the chambers." - J.C. Pressac, "Technique & Operation..." page 136

# leuchter report
testimony from lab manager James Roth: <http://www.errolmorris.com/film/mrd_transcript.html> I don't think the Leuchter results have any meaning. There's nothing in any of our data that says those surfaces were exposed or not. Even after I got off the stand, I didn't know where the samples came from. I didn't know which samples were which. And it was only at lunch that I found out, really, what the case involved. Hindsight being 20/20, the test was not the correct one to have been used for the analysis. He presented us with rock samples anywhere from the size of your thumb up to half the size of your fist. **We broke them up with a hammer so that we could get a sub-sample; we placed it in a flask, add concentrated sulfuric acid.** It undergoes a reaction that produces a red-colored solution. It is the intensity of this red color that we can relate with cyanide concentration. You have to look at what happens to cyanide when it reacts with a wall. Where does it go? How far does it go? **Cyanide is a surface reaction. It's probably not going to penetrate more than 10 microns. Human hair is 100 microns in diameter. Crush this sample up, I have just diluted that sample 10,000; 100,000 times. If you're going to go look for it, you're going to look on the surface only.** There's no reason to go deep, because it's not going to be there. Which was the exposed surface? I didn't even have any idea. **That's like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber that's behind it.** If they go in with blinders on, they will see what they want to see. What was he really trying to do? What was he trying to prove?

none of the almanac estimates before 1949 were based on new data. the almanac's revised estimate for population change 1939 to 1949 is -5,376,520: <http://archive.is/ZaYxK> <http://www.nizkor.org/features/denial-of-science/worldalmanac.html> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/566326914998992896/unknown.png The difference between the 1938 and 1948 figures is thus 4,481,491. In 1949, however, the World Almanac gives a revised 1939 population of 16,643,120 giving a difference of between 1938 and 1947 of 5,376,520. Where the extra population between 1938 and 1939 came from is not cited, though one might speculate that it was based upon the Nazi estimates made in 1942 for the Wannsee Conference. Despite the apparent exactness of the numbers listed, the World Almanac warns that all numbers listed are estimates.
Deniers consider one of their stronger arguments to be the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They claim that the 1940 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1949 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. In their view this makes it impossible that 6 million Jews died, even given an extremely high birth rate. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deliberate extermination of millions of Jews, cannot have happened. [....] In addition, rather than using more accurate census figures and other records, Holocaust deniers rely on a popular compendium whose methodology of assessment is unknown, and whose estimates have varied significantly. For example, the 1982 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 14,318,000, while the 1990 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 18,169,000, and the 1996 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 13,451,000. Either 3.7 million Jews appeared unnoticed between 1982 and 1990, and then 4.5 million Jews disappeared equally unnoticed between 1990 and 1996, or the World Almanac is not a particularly reliable source for accurate estimates of worldwide Jewish population.
This subjectivity, commonly stemming from biases or selectivity of available sources, usually means that Holocaust deniers often ignore the documents produced by the Nazis themselves, who used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the Wannsee Conference. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the Korherr Report, which gave the status of the Final Solution through December, 1942: The total number of Jews in the world in 1937 is generally estimated at around 17 million, thereof more than 10 million in Europe... From 1937 to the beginning of 1943 the number of Jews, partially due to the excess mortality of the Jews in Central and Western Europe, partially due to the evacuations especially in the more strongly populated Eastern Territories which are here counted as off-going, should have diminished by an estimated 4 million. It must not be overlooked in this respect that of the deaths of Soviet Russian Jews in the occupied Eastern territories only a part was recorded, whereas deaths in the rest of European Russia and at the front are not included at all.... On the whole European Jewry should since 1933, i.e. in the first decade of National Socialist German power, have lost almost half of its population.

# diesel engines
Sobibor: <https://www.hdot.org/debunking-denial/ds6-engines-used/> SS men Franz Hödl and Erich Fuchs were in charge of installing, maintaining, and operating the gas chamber engine at the Sobibor death camp. Fuchs specifically stated that the engine used at Sobibor was a gasoline engine: “We unloaded the motor. It was a heavy Russian petrol [gasoline] engine (presumably from a tank or tractor engine) of at least 200 HP (V-engine, 8 cylinder, water cooled).”[2] Likewise, Hödl also confirmed that there was a gasoline engine at Sobibor: “In the engine room there were indeed two engines. There was a petrol engine, probably from a Russian tank, and a diesel engine. The latter [the diesel engine] was never used, however.”[3]
Belzec: We have no testimony from the SS men who used the engine at Belzec. Kurt Gerstein, the SS officer who visited the camp in August 1942, described the engine as a diesel engine. However, he does not say how he knew what type of engine it was, so his testimony is less than conclusive. However, another eyewitness did see and interact with the engine at Belzec. Rudolf Reder was one of just two Jewish survivors from the 450,000 or more Jews murdered at Belzec. In 1944, Reder made a statement to the Central Commission for Investigation of German Crimes in Poland regarding the engines used at Belzec. He described the engine as a “motor pedzony benzyna [gasoline-powered motor].” Reder also said that he carried 4 to 5 cans of petrol (gas) (kanistry benzyny) every day to the motor room of the gas chambers. Reder used the Polish word for gasoline (benzyny/benzyna) not diesel, which is ‘olej napedowy.’[4] Reder’s testimony indicates that the engine at Belzec was also probably a gasoline engine.
Treblinka: There is one direct eyewitness who actually used the engine at the Treblinka death camp: Nikolay Shalayev. He was one of the so-called Treblinka “motorists.” He testified: “It was an ordinary, four-cylinder engine which used gasoline and, according to the story of the German machine operator, was of Russian make.”[5] As one of the operators of the engine, his evidence indicates that the engine used at Treblinka might have been a gasoline engine as well.

as amateur historian TIK notes, the USSR did not beat the Nazis with manpower alone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7BE8CsM9ds
despite having a smaller economy and facing millions of casualties, the USSR outproduced and outfought the Nazis: <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/public/totalwar2005.pdf> Yet table 1 showed that the Soviet Union was not superior to Germany in overall resources. Although Soviet GDP exceeded Germany’s in 1940, German wartime mobilization and the deep invasion of Soviet territory shifted the balance strongly in Germany’s favour. In the most critical years of the war overall Soviet resources were only 70 per cent of Germany’s, and the increment arising from Allied aid compensated only to a small extent. It is true that Germany was engaged on two fronts. Taking this into account, the Soviet Union still maintained a bigger army in the field than Germany and outproduced German industry systematically in weapons other than warships

the Nazis had plans to invade the USSR: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#German_invasion_plans>

the Communists did not have plans to invade Germany: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#Soviet_preparations> Historians have debated whether Stalin was planning an invasion of German territory in the summer of 1941. The debate began in the late-1980s when Viktor Suvorov published a journal article and later the book Icebreaker in which he claimed that Stalin had seen the outbreak of war in Western Europe as an opportunity to spread communist revolutions throughout the continent, and that the Soviet military was being deployed for an imminent attack at the time of the German invasion.[153] This view had also been advanced by former German generals following the war.[154] Suvorov's thesis was fully or partially accepted by a limited number of historians, including Valeri Danilov, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov, and Vladimir Nevezhin, and attracted public attention in Germany, Israel, and Russia.[155][156] It has been strongly rejected by most historians,[157][158] and Icebreaker is generally considered to be an "anti-Soviet tract" in Western countries.[159] David Glantz and Gabriel Gorodetsky wrote books to rebut Suvorov's arguments.[160] The majority of historians believe that Stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941, as he believed that his military was not ready to fight the German forces.[161]

Nazi saboteur units (Abwehr agents) opened fire on a retreating Polish army and were summarily executed. In response, the Polish army may have engaged in disorganized mob lynching that killed up to 300 Germans.

After German forces took the city, they executed 1800-3800 Poles as "revenge". <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_(1939)> On 04 October 1939, Adolf Hitler granted amnesty for all crimes committed by German military in Poland between 01 September and 04 October. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1939#October_4,_1939_(Wednesday)>

Timothy Snyder, liberal historian of Eastern European atrocities (he wrote a whole triology, "Bloodlands", on the subject): <https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/03/10/hitler-vs-stalin-who-killed-more/> Today, after two decades of access to Eastern European archives, and thanks to the work of German, Russian, Israeli, and other scholars, we can resolve the question of numbers. The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did.

# economy: socialism
the 1982 crash was caused by privatization: <https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/nov/22/observerbusiness.theobserver> Pinochet did not destroy Chile's economy all by himself. He had the help of academia's most brilliant minds: a gaggle of Milton Friedman's trainees, the Chicago Boys. Under their spell, the General abolished the minimum wage, outlawed union bargaining, privatised the pension system, abolished all taxes on wealth and business profits, slashed public employment, privatised 212 industries and 66 banks and ran a fiscal surplus. Free of the dead hand of bureaucracy, taxes and unions, the country took a giant leap... into bankruptcy and depression. After nine years of Chicago-style economics, Chile's industry keeled over and died. [....] The Chicago Boys persuaded the junta that removing restrictions on the nation's banks would free them to attract foreign capital to fund industrial expansion. Pinochet sold off the state banks - at a 40 per cent discount against book value. They fell into the hands of two conglomerate empires, controlled by speculators Javier Vial and Manuel Cruzsat. Using these banks, Vial and Cruzat bought up manufacturers, then leveraged these assets with loans from foreign investors panting for their piece of the state giveaway. By 1982, the pyramid finance game was up. The Vial and Cruzat 'Grupos' defaulted. Industry shut down, private pensions became worthless, and the currency swooned. Riots and strikes by a population too desperate to fear bullets forced Pinochet to boot out his beloved Chicago experimentalists.
after the crash, Pinochet moved back towards socialism: <https://www.theguardian.com/business/1998/nov/22/observerbusiness.theobserver> Reluctantly, the General restored the minimum wage and collective bargaining. Having previously decimated the ranks of state employees, he authorised a programme to create 500,000 jobs. Chile was pulled from depression by dull old Keynesian remedies, all Franklin Roosevelt, zero Margaret Thatcher. (The junta even instituted what is today South America's only law restricting the flow of foreign capital.) New Deal tactics rescued Chile from the panic of 1983, but the nation's long-term recovery and growth is the result of (cover the children's ears) a large dose of socialism. To save the nation's pension system, Pinochet nationalised banks and industry on a scale unimagined by Salvador Allende. The General expropriated at will, offering little or no compensation. While most were eventually reprivatised, the state retained ownership of one industry: copper. For nearly a century, copper has meant Chile and Chile has meant copper. Dr Janet Finn, metals expert at the University of Montana, remarks: 'It's absurd to describe a nation as a miracle of free enterprise when the engine of the economy remains in government hands.' (And not just any government: a Pinochet law, still in force, gives the military 10 per cent of state copper revenues.) Copper has provided between 30 and 70 per cent of the nation's export earnings. This is the hard currency that has built today's Chile. The proceeds from the mines seized from Anaconda and Kennecott in 1973 was Allende's posthumous gift to his nation. Agribusiness was the second locomotive of the Allende years. According to Professor Arturo Vasquez of Georgetown University, Washington DC, Allende's land reform, the break-up of feudal estates (which Pinochet could not fully reverse), created a new class of productive tiller-owners who, along with corporate and co-operative operators, now bring in a stream of export earnings to rival copper.

# economy: sabotague
the CIA funded the truckers and taxi strikes that crippled the Chilean economy: <https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/20/archives/cia-is-linked-to-strikes-in-chile-that-beset-allend> The Central Intelligence Agency secretly financed striking labor unions and trade groups in Chile for more than 18 months before President Salvador Allende Gossens was overthrown, intelligence sources revealed today. They said that the majority of more than $8 million authorized for clandestine C.I.A. activities in Chile was used in 1972 and 1973 to provide strike benefits and other means of support for anti‐Allende strikers and workers. [....] Among those heavily subsidized, the sources said, were the organizers of a nationwide truck strike that lasted 26 days in the fall of 1972, seriously disrupting Chile's economy and provoking the first of a series of labor crises for President Allende. Continue reading the main story Direct subsidies, the sources said, also were provided for a strike of middle‐class shopkeepers and a taxi strike among others, that disrupted the capital city of Santiago in the summer of 1973, shortly before Mr. Allende was over thrown by a military coup. At its peak, the 1973 strikes involved more than 250,000 truck drivers, shopkeepers and professionals who banded to gether in a middle‐class move ment that, many analysts have concluded, made a violent overthrow inevitable.
shop-owners and the USA both worked to create an artificial shortage of food: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106>: The march protested shortages of foodstuffs and a distribution system that generated long lines of shoppers waiting to buy basic products at controlled prices. The shortages themselves were a product of conservative obstruction, as store owners took items off the shelves and sold them on the black market; the opposition media created panic-buying by reporting on shortages that did not (yet) exist, and Washington instituted an “invisible blockade” by denying credit to the UP government.
the IMF, acting for US interests, largely blocked loan requests from Chile: <http://michael-hudson.com/2003/10/chiles-failed-economic-laboratory/> After Pinochet was installed, the IMF and World Bank restructured Chilean debt on much more favorable terms than those afforded Allende, and foreign banks returned almost overnight.
the IMF was more than happy to give big loans to Pinochet: <https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/05/business/chile-is-expected-to-get-900-million-imf-loan.html> <https://archive.fo/lFaBw>

# CIA opposition
the CIA funded the 1964 election: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> "The CIA sweetened the alliance, providing an estimated $4 million of covert assistance to Frei and stood behind the PDC’s scare campaign designed to play to women voters, intimating that if Allende won, they stood to lose their children, their homes, and even the concept of motherhood itself."
the CIA funded the 1970 election: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> With polling predicting an Alessandri victory, and the CIA funding a spoiling operation designed to raise fears of Allende, Washington expected voters would again reject the socialist.
the CIA planned to sabotague Allende's presidency: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> A smooth transition was further undermined by the Nixon Administration’s determination to block Allende. As part of a broader scheme, the CIA supplied a group of right-wing plotters with arms and funding to kidnap the constitutionalist Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General René Schneider, an outrage to be blamed on the Left and designed to prod the military into action against Allende.45 The plot failed, Schneider was killed, and on October 24, Congress elected the UP’s candidate. But intransigent opposition to Allende from Washington, the National Party, and an emerging paramilitary right, together with Christian Democratic distrust, suggested how demanding would be his task ahead.

most of the claims of authoritarianism under Allende -- terrorist training camps, Plan Z, "17,000 Cubans", are provably false: https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1999/01/28/blackwashing-allende
Allende refused the revolutionary path, to his party's leadership's chagrin: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> Debate within the PS revealed a sharply divided party. Members of the party’s Central Committee, having declared the party Marxist-Leninist in 1967, opposed Allende’s selection, but the rank-and-file and regional party heads were firm in their support for the only person they thought could unite the left. In January 1970, the UP named him their candidate. It was, the Communist’s Luís Corvalán dryly observed, “a forceps birth.”
Allende's economic policy was aimed at increasing democratic support: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore> Allende’s approach tightly entwined economic and political policy. An economy that expanded through Keynesian demand-side measures, advanced national producers at the expense of multinational firms and small businesses over monopolies, turned land over to peasant cultivators, and redistributed income, would also, he predicted, engender support at the polls. With enough time, he could introduce a plebiscite allowing the constitutional changes needed to give him the authority to further expand state control of the economy, create a single legislative chamber, and reform the judiciary.
Allende refused to use military power to implement his goals: <https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-106> When Army General Roberto Viaux revolted against Frei in 1969, the Central Committee of the Socialist Party called on workers “not to defend the bourgeois institutional order, but [instead] to mobilize around their own social and political demands.” Allende vigorously dissented and rushed to the Moneda to show his support for the President.66 And yet, Allende’s conviction that the military must respect the constitutional order was not shared by his conservative opponents. Even before Allende was elected, Jorge Alessandri, in a May 1970 campaign speech, had called on the “patriotic” military to intervene as needed “to save the liberty that we so love” from those who hold “criminal doctrines.”67

# quotes
MLK on Goldwater: "On the urgent issue of civil rights, Senator Goldwater represented a philosophy that was morally indefensible and socially suicidal. While not himself a racist, Mr. Goldwater articulated a philosophy which gave aid and comfort to the racist. His candidacy and philosophy would serve as an umbrella under which extremists of all stripes would stand."
RNC Chairman Michael Steele: "For the last 40-plus years we had a "Southern strategy" that alienated many minority voters by focusing on the white male vote in the South. Well, guess what happened in 1992, folks, "Bubba" went back home to the Democratic Party and voted for Bill Clinton."
Nixon political strategist Kevin Phillips: "From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that... but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats."
Reagan and Bush I strategist: "You start out in 1954 by saying, "N\*\*\*\*r, n\*\*\*\*r, n\*\*\*\*r." By 1968 you can't say "n\*\*\*\*r" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me — because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this," is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "n\*\*\*\*r, n\*\*\*\*r.""

Reduce firearm deaths without seizing guns in four easy steps:
[1] Ban industrial firearm manufacture (shut down firearm factories) -- easy as fuck
[2] Fund slow mandatory firearm buybacks (1% per year) -- it's worth it, given that firearms cause $176bn/yr in damages
[3] Seize guns from criminals (as police normally do) -- literally no change from the status quo
[4] Ban inheritance or sale of firearms -- even if mostly unenforced, will decrease criminal access to firearms

Specifically, participants indicated the extent to which they agree (1=agree strongly to 5=disagree strongly) with statements such as “Generations of slavery and discrimination have created conditions that make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class” (reverse scored). Scores on the four items were coded so that high scores are indicative of elevated levels of symbolic racism. A test of the reliability of the scale showed the four items corresponded closely with each other as indicated by a Cronbach’s alpha level of 0.8 and the emergence of a single factor from exploratory factor analysis of the scale. We utilized the average score across the four items to produce a scale ranging 1=lowest symbolic racism score, to 5=highest symbolic racism score.
higher opposition to gun regulations is predicted by higher symbolic racism, higher firearm ownership, higher libertarianism, lower egalitarianism, and lower income: <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11109-015-9326-4> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/s11109-015-9326-4> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/639991539585515530/unknown.png

Moreover, regardless of commitment ability, the model suggests the imperfectly competitive firms may, at least partially, counteract the buyback program, making any governmental buyback less effective at reducing future firearm stocks than expected.

[....] The reduction that was found in gun robberies took several years to materialise. Thus, studies of a gun buy-back programme may require longer time frames before some level of success is achieved (Neill & Leigh, 2008).

# stolen firearms
based on surveys of firearm owners, ~460,000 firearms are stolen from individuals every year: <https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/3/5/38.abstract> <https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/rsfjss/3/5/38.full.pdf> Approximately 2.4 percent of gun owners (CI: 1.6–3.6) reported having had one or more stolen from them in the past five years, the mean number at 1.9 (a range of 1 to 6). Assuming that theft was evenly distributed across the years, we estimate that approximately 2.3 million guns were stolen over the past five years (five hundred thousand annually).
based on surveys of firearm owners, ~380,000 firearms are stolen from individuals every year: <https://injepijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40621-017-0109-8> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1186/s40621-017-0109-8> Among gun owners, 2.4% report having one or more guns stolen in the past 5 years (Table 1). The mean number of guns stolen per incident was 1.5(95% CI: 1.0,2.0). Using data from the April 2015 survey, we estimated that 22% of US adults are gun owners (Azrael et al. 2015), consistent with findings from the General Social Surveys from the University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center (Smith and Son 2015). Using these results, and given approximately 242 million adults lived in the US (average for 2011–2015), we estimate that there were 1.2 million incidents of gun theft over a 5-year period, or about 250,000 incidents per year. With 1.5 guns stolen per incident, we estimate that approximately 380,000 guns (95% CI 260,000,510,000) were stolen per year.
based on FBI crime statistics, ~320,000 firearms are stolen from individuals and gun stores every year: <https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2017/07/25/436533/stolen-guns-america/> Gun theft is not a minor problem in the United States. According to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), during the four-year period from 2012 to 2015, nearly half a billion dollars worth of guns were stolen from individuals nationwide, amounting to an estimated 1.2 million guns. Twenty-two thousand guns were stolen from gun stores during this same period.

guns flow from states with weak firearm laws to states with strong firearm laws; each additional law decreases by 1.56% the portion of firearms traced to a source in that state: (laws: dealer licensing for handguns, waiting periods, buyer licensing, registration of handgun sales, prohibition for violent misdemeanors, mandatory firearm relinquishment after prohibition, universal background checks, and straw purchase bans): <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11524-018-0251-9> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1007/11524-018-0251-9> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643145969004707850/unknown.png
unformatted / remove: firearm control is effective at reducing illegal firearm ownership and trafficking to other states: <https://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/full/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.5.01>: Because an estimated 270 million guns are in private hands nationwide, effective control is said to be beyond reach (Azrael et al. 2017). But this “futility” claim is in our judgment based on a misunderstanding of how guns come to be used in criminal violence. Despite that the number of private guns is enough to arm every adult, the great majority of adults (78 percent) do not in fact own one. **The main concern should be less about the current stock of guns in private hands and more about the flow of guns: the ease of obtaining one for criminal purposes.** [....] Real-world markets tend to be a good deal messier than Economics 101 reveals, and underground markets particularly so. [....] **[T]he money price is not the only or necessarily the most important cost to obtaining a gun outside the formal market. Other types of transactions costs are relevant, including the search time required for the buyer and seller to find each other, the payments to a broker or other intermediary, and the risk of arrest.** [....] We report evidence suggesting that in some respects the underground market is sensitive to regulation. For example, **when Virginia adopted a one gun per month maximum on handgun sales to any one customer, that state’s prominence as a “source” state in trafficking to Massachusetts and other states with relatively stringent regulations dropped sharply** (see Braga 2017).

# use in crime
most firearm used in crimes come from household thefts: https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092149: Guns are legal commodities, but violent offenders typically obtain their guns by illegal means. Our knowledge of these transactions comes primarily from trace data on guns recovered by the police and from occasional surveys of gun-involved offenders. **Because most guns used in crime are sourced from the stock of guns in private hands (rather than a purchase from a licensed dealer), the local prevalence of gun ownership appears to influence the transaction costs and the proportions of robberies and assaults committed with guns rather than knives or other weapons**. Nonetheless, regulations that govern licensed dealers have been linked to trafficking patterns and in some cases to the use of guns in crime.
UNFORMATTED <https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/guns-crime/reports/2017/07/25/436533/stolen-guns-america/> A 2000 ATF report that reviewed all firearms trafficking investigations undertaken by the agency between July 1996 and December 1998—the most recent such study the agency has conducted—found that nearly 14 percent of those cases involved guns stolen from licensed gun dealers and another 10 percent involved guns stolen from private residences.11 These investigations involved more than 9,300 illegally trafficked guns.12 Another study analyzed data on 893 guns recovered by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Firearms Trafficking Unit in 2008 and found that for close to 32 percent of these firearms, their original owners claimed they had been stolen.13

firearms correlate with overall homicide: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953606004898 Two of every three American homicide victims are killed with firearms, yet little is known about the role played by household firearms in homicide victimization. The present study is the first to examine the cross sectional association between household firearm ownership and homicide victimization across the 50 US states, by age and gender, using nationally representative state-level survey-based estimates of household firearm ownership. Household firearm prevalence for each of the 50 states was obtained from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Homicide mortality data for each state were aggregated over the three-year study period, 2001–2003. Analyses controlled for state-level rates of aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, urbanization, per capita alcohol consumption, and a resource deprivation index (a construct that includes median family income, the percentage of families living beneath the poverty line, the Gini index of family income inequality, the percentage of the population that is black and the percentage of families headed by a single female parent). **Multivariate analyses found that states with higher rates of household firearm ownership had significantly higher homicide victimization rates of men, women and children.** The association between firearm prevalence and homicide victimization in our study was driven by gun-related homicide victimization rates; non-gun-related victimization rates were not significantly associated with rates of firearm ownership. Although causal inference is not warranted on the basis of the present study alone, **our findings suggest that the household may be an important source of firearms used to kill men, women and children in the United States.**
firearm prevalence correlates with overall homicide: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178903000442 This article reviews the most commonly cited, representative, empirical studies in the peer-reviewed literature that directly investigate the association of gun availability and homicide victimization. Individual-level studies (n=4) are reviewed that investigate the risks and benefits of owning a personal or household firearm. The research suggests that households with firearms are at higher risk for homicide, and there is no net beneficial effect of firearm ownership. No longitudinal cohort study seems to have investigated the association between a gun in the home and homicide. Two groups of ecological studies are reviewed, those comparing multiple countries and those focused solely on the United States. Results from the cross-sectional international studies (n=7) typically show that in high-income countries with more firearms, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide. Time series (n=10) and cross-sectional studies (n=9) of U.S. cities, states, and regions and for the United States as a whole, generally find a statistically significant gun prevalence–homicide association. **None of the studies prove causation, but the available evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that increased gun prevalence increases the homicide rate.**
firearm prevalence correlates with overall homicides: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1a29/31f453c4b1ed85eca34f89defb7842285cad.pdf METHODS: Homicide rates for the early 1990s come from 26 of 27 of the highly industrialized or high-income countries with greater than 1 million population as classified by the World Bank. Two common proxies for gun availability are used, the percentage of suicides with a firearm, and the "Cook index," the average of the percentage of suicides with a firearm and the percentage of homicides with a firearm. RESULTS: In simple regressions (no control variables) across 26 high-income nations, there is a strong and statistically significant association between gun availability and homicide rates. **CONCLUSION: Across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.**
firearms are correlated with homicides: http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2014/04/16/injuryprev-2014-041187.short Determining the relationship between gun ownership levels and firearm homicide rates is critical to inform public health policy. Previous research has shown that state-level gun ownership, as measured by a widely used proxy, is positively associated with firearm homicide rates. A newly developed proxy measure that incorporates the hunting license rate in addition to the proportion of firearm suicides correlates more highly with state-level gun ownership. To corroborate previous research, we used this new proxy to estimate the association of state-level gun ownership with total, firearm, and non-firearm homicides. Using state-specific data for the years 1981–2010, we modelled these rates as a function of gun ownership level, controlling for potential confounding factors. We used a negative binomial regression model and accounted for clustering of observations among states. **We found that state-level gun ownership as measured by the new proxy, is significantly associated with firearm and total homicides but not with non-firearm homicides.**

the total suicide rate of soldiers decreased 40% after Israel prohibited its soldiers from taking their firearms home on the weekends: <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1521/suli.2010.40.5.421> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1521/suli.2010.40.5.421> The overall rates of suicide before the policy change are in line with rates of suicide in adolescents in this age group (Mann et al., 2005; Perret et al., 2006; Powell, Fingerhut, Branche, & Perrotta, 2000). Following the change in policy total suicide rate decreased by 40%, from an average of 28 per year dur- ing 2003-2005 to an average of 16.5 per year in 2007-2008 (T= 3.35, p = .04). Most of this decrease in suicide rates was due to a de- crease in suicide using firearms over the weekend, from an average of 10 per year (2003-2005) to an average of 3 per year (2007-2008) (T= 17.44, p<.001). There were no significant changes in rates of suicide during weekdays.
Connecticut's permit to purchase (PTP) law for handguns significantly decreased overall suicide: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743515002297> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.07.013> Connecticut's firearm suicide rates were 15.4% lower than that of its synthetic control during the 10-year post-law period. [....] Connecticut's non-firearm suicide rates, however, were 11.9% lower during the post-law period than predicted by the synthetic control.
males with a firearm in the household have a suicide rate 10x that of those that don't: <https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/10/929/140858> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1093/aje/kwh309> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643891303985315861/unknown.png Data from a US mortality follow-back survey were analyzed to determine whether having a firearm in the home increases the risk of a violent death in the home and whether risk varies by storage practice, type of gun, or number of guns in the home. [....] **The risk of dying from a suicide in the home was greater for males in homes with guns than for males without guns in the home (adjusted odds ratio = 10.4, 95% confidence interval: 5.8, 18.9).** Persons with guns in the home were also more likely to have died from suicide committed with a firearm than from one committed by using a different method (adjusted odds ratio = 31.1, 95% confidence interval: 19.5, 49.6).

# correlation
meta-study proves that firearm prevalence correlates with risk of suicide [3.24x] and homicide [2x]: <http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(15)01030-X/abstract> Data were pooled from 16 observational studies that assessed the odds of suicide or homicide, **yielding pooled ORs of 3.24 (95% CI, 2.41 to 4.40) and 2.00 (CI, 1.56 to 3.02), respectively**. When only studies that used interviews to determine firearm accessibility were considered, the pooled OR for suicide was 3.14 (CI, 2.29 to 4.43).
a 1% increase of firearm prevalence correlates with a 1.4% increase of overall suicide, controlling for poverty, urbanization, unemployment, mental illness, and drug and alcohol dependence and abuse: <https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005373-200704000-00031> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1097/01.ta.0000198214.24056.40> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643885297578278941/unknown.png

# alternate methods
suicides by firearm are much more effective: <https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446422/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.2105/ajph.90.12.1885> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640008148450672656/CaseFatality7-1200x657.png The present study is, to our knowledge, the first multistate epidemiologic examination of pooled E-coded discharge data and vital statistics data. We integrated these data into a single epidemiologic analysis of nearly 65000 medically identified suicide attempts and 11000 suicides to compute annual incidence of suicide acts and case fatality rates in 8 states, by victim age, sex, and race and by method used. [....] Choice of method plays a role in the lethality of the suicide act. Firearm is the most lethal method and drug overdose/poison ingestion the least lethal.
firearms are more fatal than other methods; if the US had comparable firearm prevalence as other countries, it would have 20-38% fewer suicides:: <https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonkblog/suicide-rates/> <http://archive.is/mAcn3> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/643883153387159603/unknown.png

# impulsivity
just 8.8% of suicide attempts are fatal, and fatality increases with age: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1446422/> <https://sci-hub.se/10.2105/ajph.90.12.1885> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640010298258096134/unknown.png
most suicides are impulsive: <https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0805923> <https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/suli.32.1.5.49.24212> First, many suicidal acts — one third to four fifths of all suicide attempts, according to studies — are impulsive. Among people who made near-lethal suicide attempts, for example, 24% took less than 5 minutes between the decision to kill themselves and the actual attempt, and 70% took less than 1 hour.
most suicides are impulsive: <http://seattlefriends.org/files/seiden_study.pdf> Finally, in Table 13 we have the proportion of persons in each study group who subsequently committed suicide or died from other violent causes. What this table discloses is that after 26-plus years the vast majority of GGB suicide attempters (about 94%) are still alive or have died from natural causes. The comparison group of hospital cases has had similar experiences; 89% are still alive or are dead from natural means after 15 years. Conversely, only five to seven percent killed themselves and some six to 11% had died from all violent causes combined. Even if we compensate for underenumeration by doubling our frequencies it still means that about 90% of the study subjects were alive or had come to a natural non-violent end.
most suicides are impulsive: <https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/article/Pages/2001/v62n07/v62n07a11.aspx> More than half of the attempts were impulsive (55%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51% to 59%), approximately one fourth of the attempts had an intermediate level of impulsivity (28%; 95% CI, 24% to 32%), and approximately one sixth of the attempts were not impulsive (17%, 95% CI, 13% to 21%). There was an inverse association between the impulsivity and lethality of the suicide attempt (chi2 = 62.639, df = 6, p < .0001). The most impulsive attempts tended to result in less morbidity, while the less impulsive attempts tended to be more lethal.

SDGU was more common among males, in rural areas, away from home, against male offenders and against offenders with a gun. After any protective action, 4.2% of victims were injured; after SDGU, 4.1% of victims were injured. In property crimes, 55.9% of victims who took protective action lost property, 38.5 of SDGU victims lost property, and 34.9% of victims who used a weapon other than a gun lost property.

In addition, there was a positive correlation (r^2 0.52; P = .005) between mental illness burden in a country and firearm-related deaths. However, there was no significant correlation (P = .10) between guns per capita per country and crime rate (r^2 .33), or between mental illness and crime rate (r^2 0.32; P = .11). In a linear regression model with firearm-related deaths as the dependent variable with gun ownership and mental illness as independent covariates, gun ownership was a significant predictor (P <.0001) of firearm-related deaths, whereas mental illness was of borderline significance (P = .05) only

the seriously mentally ill don't disproportionately commit crimes (4% population, 4% crimes) and they use less firearms in the crimes they do commit: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/>: [S]urprisingly little population-level evidence supports the notion that individuals diagnosed with mental illness are more likely than anyone else to commit gun crimes. **According to Appelbaum,25 less than 3% to 5% of US crimes involve people with mental illness, and the percentages of crimes that involve guns are lower than the national average for persons not diagnosed with mental illness.** Databases that track gun homicides, such as the National Center for Health Statistics, similarly show that fewer than 5% of the 120,000 gun-related killings in the United States between 2001 and 2010 were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness.26 [....] [A] number of the most common psychiatric diagnoses, including depressive, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorders, have no correlation with violence whatsoever.18 **Community studies find that serious mental illness without substance abuse is also “statistically unrelated” to community violence.40** At the aggregate level, the vast majority of people diagnosed with psychiatric disorders do not commit violent acts—only about 4% of violence in the United States can be attributed to people diagnosed with mental illness.41,42

# lone wolves
the vast majority of violence is not done by "loners": <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/>: Contrary to the image of the marauding lone gunman, social relationships also predict gun violence. Regression analyses by Papachristos et al. demonstrate that up to 85% of shootings occur within social networks.60 In other words, **people are far more likely to be shot by relatives, friends, enemies, or acquaintances than they are by lone violent psychopaths.** Meanwhile, a report by the police department of New York City found that, in 2013, a person was “more likely to die in a plane crash, drown in a bathtub or perish in an earthquake” than be murdered by a crazed stranger in that city.61

# psychologists
psychologists are bad at predicting gun violence: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/: [R]esearch dating back to the 1970s suggests that psychiatrists using clinical judgment are not much better than laypersons at predicting which individual patients will commit violent crimes and which will not.

Prisons should not be used with the expectation of reducing criminal behaviour. 2. On the basis of the present results, excessive use of incarceration has enormous cost implications. 3. In order to determine who is being adversely affected by prison, it is incumbent upon prison officials to implement repeated, comprehensive assessments of offenders’ attitudes, values, and behaviours while incarcerated. 4. The primary justification of prison should be to incapacitate offenders (particularly, those of a chronic, higher risk nature) for reasonable periods and to exact retribution.`

juvenile incarceration is very expensive: <https://www.aecf.org/resources/no-place-for-kids-full-report/> <https://www.aecf.org/m/resourcedoc/aecf-NoPlaceForKidsFullReport-2011.pdf> Multisystemic Therapy (MST) and Functional Family Therapy (FFT) are intensive family treatment models for delinquent youth. In MST, therapists lead a regimented three- to five-month family intervention process involving multiple contacts each week in the family’s home and surrounding community. FFT employs office-based counseling (an average of 12 sessions) designed first to engage family members and then to support meaningful behavior changes that improve family interaction and address the underlying causes of delinquent behavior. Costs average $6,000 to $9,500 per youth for MST and $3,000 to $3,500 for FFT, whereas **a typical stay in a juvenile corrections facility (9 to 12 months at $241 per day) costs $66,000 to $88,000.**

In 1992, 52 percent of newly diagnosed AIDS cases in New York were among I.V. drug users. By 2012, intravenous drug users accounted for only 3 percent of new H.I.V. diagnoses.

# crime
the illegal drug market causes violent crime and cannot be solved by increased law enforcement: <http://www.ijdp.org/article/S0955-3959(11)00022-3/fulltext> The present systematic review demonstrates that drug law enforcement interventions are unlikely to reduce drug market violence. Instead, and contrary to the conventional wisdom that increasing drug law enforcement will reduce violence, the existing scientific evidence base suggests that drug prohibition likely contributes to drug market violence and increased homicide rates and that increasingly sophisticated methods of disrupting illicit drug distribution networks may in turn increase levels of violence.

Over one-third of wives of police officers (37%) reported violence in their marriage. (Neidig, Russell, and Seng, unpublished). A 1981 survey of Toronto police officers found a divorce and separation rate of 63%, almost double the national average among Canadians at the time.

For the states passing same-sex marriage at the state level, the demonstrated pattern was identical to that evident in models 1–3 (Fig. 3). Bias decreased at roughly double the rate over time following legalization (B = −0.0112, SE = 0.0006, P < 0.001). In sharp contrast, for the 15 states that did not pass same-sex marriage legalization locally, antigay bias increased over time following legalization (B = 0.0215, SE = 0.0065, P < 0.001). [....] In states that did not pass same-sex marriage legalization locally, we find a reactive or “backlash” effect (27) such that federal legalization was associated with increased antigay bias over time, despite the decreasing trend in bias in these states before federal legalization. The specific factors driving this effect cannot be addressed by the present data. One possibility is that, even though attitudes were improving, a tipping point of local support had not yet been reached for the majority to accept the federal ruling. Research at the individual level suggests that the attention given the federal decision may have sharpened some respondents’ sense of symbolic threat to their lifestyle and values (43), and this sense of threat could have exacerbated antigay biases among those individuals.

# jews: "natural history" [UNFORMATTED]
cochran claims that mutations more common in Jewish subpopulations <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-biosocial-science/article/natural-history-of-ashkenazi-intelligence/170E96F5581A9F39524DAC717886D945> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1017/S0021932005027069>
Genetic studies have suggested that most Ashkenazi Jewish congenital diseases arose from genetic drift after a population bottleneck, a phenomenon known as the founder effect, rather than from selective pressure favoring those genes as called for by the Cochran, et al. hypothesis.[12][17] To take one example, the mutation responsible for Tay–Sachs disease arose in the 8th or 9th century, when the Ashkenazi Jewish population in Europe was small, just before they spread throughout Europe. The high frequency of this disease among Ashkenazi Jews today might simply be the result of their not marrying outside their group, not because the gene for Tay–Sachs disease confers an advantage that more than makes up for the fact that the disease usually kills by age three.[12] However, an examination of the frequencies and locations of the genes for 21 Ashkenazi Jewish congenital diseases suggested that six of them do appear to result from selective pressure, including the mutation for Tay–Sachs disease.[17] There is still no evidence one way or the other about whether the reason for this is increased intelligence for commercial skills or something else.[18]
"How Jews Became Smart: Anti-Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence" http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/sites/fasn/files/How%20Jews%20Became%20Smart%20(2008).pdf

Jewish domination of banking was a result of state policy, not intelligence: <http://faculty.history.umd.edu/BCooperman/NewCity/Stillman.html> Jews never came to dominate the financial scene in Baghdad or other medieval Islamic cities, despite the arguments to the contrary of the late Louis Massignon in a famous article, based, unfortunately, upon very scanty evidence. Most of the great bankers of the eighth through tenth centuries in the Abbasid Caliphate seem to have been Christians, and it is Christians, not Jews, who remained the stereotypical men of money in Arabic literature and lore. Even during the period of decline in the later Middle Ages, however, there were still a small number of Jews who played a significant role in the commercial and financial life of several major Islamic cities. At the close of the Middle Ages, the Jews in many Islamic urban centers began to enjoy a brief cultural and economic revival with the influx of Sephardi refugees expelled from Spain, Portugal, and Sicily. It was only in the last hundred years, however, that the Jews in the cities of the Muslim world once again underwent a tremendous social upheaval and transformation.

25 of 1483 ships (1.69%) entering Barbados in 1718-21 were wholly or partially owned by Jews: <https://books.google.com/books?id=smoVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92> <https://b-ok.cc/book/2733675/a13a71> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/644189412741218324/unknown.png Between March 25, 1718 and June 25, 1721, of 1,483 ships entering in and then clearing out, 1,458, or 98.3 percent, were owned by non-Jews (Table 4.1). Thirteen vessels, or less than 1 percent (eight-tenths of 1 percent), were owned by Jewish individuals, while an additional 12 vessels were owned by combinations of Jewish and non-Jewish partners. The majority of the Jewish individuals involved, however, did not reside in Barbados.8
between 1 (0.3%) and 0 (0%) of 345 ships entering Barbados in 1735-36 were (possibly) owned by Jews: <https://books.google.com/books?id=smoVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92> <https://b-ok.cc/book/2733675/a13a71> Between March 25, 1735 and March 25, 1736, not a single vessel that arrived in the colony belonged to a Jewish merchant. Of the 345 that entered during that period, 344, or 99.7 percent, were owned by non-Jews. In the remaining case, the Naval Office did not record the name of the owner.9
4 of 420 ships (0.95%) entering Barbados in 1774-75 were owned by Jews: <https://books.google.com/books?id=smoVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92> <https://b-ok.cc/book/2733675/a13a71> Later in the century, of 424 vessels that arrived in Barbados between January 1, 1774 and January 5, 1775, 420, or 99 percent, were owned by non-Jews.
0 of 215 Africa-destined ships from London during 1764, 1776, and 1790 had Jewish primary owners: <https://books.google.com/books?id=smoVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92> <https://b-ok.cc/book/2733675/a13a71> Lloyd’s register for 1764, the first published, listed 74 London vessels with Africa as their destination; none of the primary owners listed therein was Jewish.117 The registers for 1776 and 1790 respectively listed 72 and 69 vessels, again with primary owners whose names were not Jewish.118
0 of 190 Liverpool merchants in the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa of 1752 or 1758 were Jewish: <https://books.google.com/books?id=smoVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92> <https://b-ok.cc/book/2733675/a13a71> As in London and Bristol, the Jews of Liverpool did not own ships in the slave trade. Peddlers and petty shopkeepers, none were on the list of 101 Liverpool merchants who belonged to the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa in 1752, nor, as noted previously, among the 89 who belonged to it in 1758.127
0 of the primary owners of Liverpool's slave-trading firms in 1752, 1764, 1790, and 1807 were Jewish: <https://books.google.com/books?id=smoVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92> <https://b-ok.cc/book/2733675/a13a71> Nor were Jews to be found among the 66 primary owners of the 88 Liverpool vessels trading with Africa in 1752 that carried 24,730 slaves, or among the owners of the 80 Liverpool vessels listed by Lloyd’s as trading there in 1764.128 Twenty-six years later, in 1790, the Liverpool slave fleet of 141 vessels was owned by forty firms, none of which was Jewish. And in 1807, the year in which Britain terminated the slave trade throughout its empire, none of Liverpool’s seventy-odd companies trading to Africa was Jewish.129

# who killed the tsar / who killed the czar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_of_the_Romanov_family#Executioners> Ivan Plotnikov, history professor at the Maksim Gorky Ural State University, has established that the executioners were **Yakov Yurovsky**, **Grigory P. Nikulin**, **Mikhail A. Medvedev (Kudrin)**, **Peter Ermakov**, **Stepan Vaganov**, **Alexey G. Kabanov** (former soldier in the tsar's Life Guards and Chekist assigned to the attic machine gun),[48] **Pavel Medvedev**, **V. N. Netrebin**, and **Y. M. Tselms**. Filipp Goloshchyokin, a close associate of Yakov Sverdlov, being a military commissar of the Uralispolkom in Yekaterinburg, however did not actually participate, and two or three guards refused to take part.[153]
Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky: raised Jewish, converted Lutheran <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Yurovsky> Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky was the eighth of ten children born to Mikhail Yurovsky, a glazier, and his wife Ester Moiseevna (1848–1919), a seamstress. He was born on 19 June [O.S. 7 June] 1878 in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Russia. The Yurovsky family were Jewish. The historian Helen Rappaport writes that the young Yurovsky studied the Talmud in his early youth, while the family seems to have later attempted to distance themselves from their Jewish roots; this may have been prompted by the prejudice toward Jews frequently exhibited in Russia at the time.[1] Shortly before fully devoting himself to the cause of revolution, in the early twentieth century Yurovsky converted to Lutheranism.[1]
Grigory Petrovich Nikulin: raised in a parish school: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Petrovich_Nikulin> Nikulin was born and raised in Zvenigorodka, Kiev province, Russian Empire. He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (Пётр Иосифович) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.
Mikhail Aleksandrovich Medvedev-Kudrin: raised in a parish school: <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2,_%D0%9C%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BB_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87> В 1900 году закончил церковно-приходскую школу в селе Изгар, в 1900—1908 годах жил в Чистополе, где начал учиться в школе ремесленных учеников, но после второго класса был вынужден бросить учёбу из-за тяжёлого материального положения семьи[1]. [In 1900 he graduated from a parish school in the village of Izgar. In 1900-1908 he lived in Chistopol, where he began to study at a school of artisanal students, but after the second grade he was forced to drop out of school due to the difficult financial situation of his family.[1]]
Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov: raised in a parish school: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ermakov> Pyotr Zakharovich Ermakov was born on 13 December [O.S. 1 December] 1884, and raised in and around the Verkh-Isetskiy workhouse in Yekaterinburg, Russian Empire. Ermakov graduated from the local parish school, working thereafter as a metal craftsman, and between 1909 and 1912, is listed as living in Vologodskaya Province.
Pavel Spiridonovich Medvedev: unknown: <https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2,_%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB_%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87>

ancient agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies were very equal; an estimate based on housing size for their Gini coefficient was .35, compared to .8 in the US and .7 in China; the shift from hunting-gathering to horticulture to agriculture and the shift towards more-stratified political systems saw a significant increase in inequality: <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24646> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635206761875243009/unknown.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/635207235852697621/unknown.png

hunter-gatherers in the European Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic probably segregated work by sex, with males predominantly being projectile hunters: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248410000138> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.02.001> A sexual division of tasks concerning hunting seems most likely, based on the presence of injuries specific to spear throwing in male individuals and their absence among females. This division of labor would have begun during childhood or adolescence.
hunter-gatherers in the Near East Upper Paleolithic produced specialized tools, indicating a probable division of labor between producers and users of flint products (eg, hunters): <http://esciencecommons.blogspot.com/2015/06/stone-tools-from-jordan-point-to-dawn.html> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248415001050> <https://sci-hub.se/10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.04.008> The group of toolmakers at Mughr el-Hamamah, however, used different technologies to get different tools. “They were investing in the kinds of activities that require maintaining relationships and group planning,” Stutz says. “They were gearing up for a clearly defined division of labor, including firewood gathering, plant gathering, hunting and food foraging.” They produced large quantities of blades for knives, and for hafting onto spears, using a prismatic blade technique that yields long, narrow points that are nearly identical. “This standardization minimizes waste of the rock while maximizing the end product,” Stutz says. “It’s the conceptual forerunner to assembly-line production.”

lead consumption *increased* with economic status: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128153390000147> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/B978-0-12-815339-0.00014-7> Contamination of food, wine, and olive oil due to preparation in pewter or lead containers, and addition of sugar lead (sapa) were important causes of lead poisoning. It has been calculated that 50-60% of a free adult Roman’s lead intake probably came from wine. The nobility and the rich, who drank up to 2 L wine per day, would thus have been predisposed to lead poisoning. Pewter ware was extensively used by the middle class. It is calculated that the Roman aristocrat probably took in 250 mg of lead per day, the plebeian 35 mg, and the slave 15 mg. This compares with 30-50 mg of lead per day for the average contemporary adult in the United States. WHO considers 45 mg per day as the maximal lead intake for a healthy individual (Nriagu, 1983; Needleman and Needleman, 1985).

# the wheel
the "Africans dumb" explanation is circular and absurd: <https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032919/http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/the_wheel_in_africa_february_2012.pdf> The conventional notion that Africans failed to employ the wheel because of lack of initiative or intelligence is intellectually unsatisfactory, not so much because it is racialist as because it is circular: Africans are supposed to have ignored the wheel because they were unenterprising, and the evidence that they were unenterprising is that they failed to adopt the wheel. In other contexts, notably in their widespread adoption of the use of imported European firearms, Africans proved eagerly receptive to innovation, and it cannot therefore be argued that they were in general conservative in their responses to new technology. There must, logically, be some special explanation for their lack of interest in the practical application of the technology of wheeled transport.
African civilizations were trapped in a vicious circle (a classic example of the "low-income trap"): <https://www.jstor.org/stable/1159117> But it was nonsensical to advocate the introduction of wheeled transport in order to stimulate road improvement: heavy expenditure on road improvement would only be attractive if wheeled transport promised commensurate savings, and the experience of 1841 might equally reasonably have prompted the discouraging conclusion that the costs involved were so great as to be prohibitive. The costs of road improvement, moreover, would have to be incurred in advance of any savings to be derived from the use of wheeled vehicles, and thus represented a very speculative venture as long as wheeled vehicles were not already in general use. Even the British colonial government in the Gold Coast baulked at the gamble in 1870, concluding that roads suitable for wheeled traffic would be too expensive to build and were in any case undesirable since 'even if good roads were built, there would be no vehicles to travel on them' (Dickson 1971:218-219). **Thus, wheeled transport could not be adopted without improved roads, but the roads would not be improved as long as there was no wheeled transport to use them. Only governments committed to a more aggressive ideology of economic progress, and therefore ready to incur speculative expenses in the confidence of ultimate economic advantage, could break out of this vicious circle; and such governments arrived in West Africa only with the European imperialism of the late nineteenth century.**
^ wheels, paricularly railroads, were ultimately very economically beneficial: https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032919/http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/the_wheel_in_africa_february_2012.pdf

# political views don't change over time
your political views are three times more malleable in your teens than in your midlife: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/08/upshot/how-the-year-you-were-born-influences-your-politics.html> <http://archive.is/0S3vo> <http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/cohort_voting_20140605.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/473938047046778880/unknown.png
different generations have different voting patterns (ie, they didn't change very much as they aged): <http://www.people-press.org/2011/11/03/section-1-how-generations-have-changed/> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/640926774758342667/11-3-11-17.png
political views solidify in your teens: <http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/> <https://books.google.com/books?id=3a927Jder6IC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage> On an individual level, of course, many people’s political views evolve over the course of their lives. But academic research indicates not only that generations have distinct political identities, but that most people’s basic  outlooks and orientations are set fairly early on in life. As one famous longitudinal study of Bennington College women put it, “through late childhood and early adolescence, attitudes are relatively malleable…with the potential for dramatic change possible in late adolescence or early adulthood. [B]ut greater stability sets in at some early point, and attitudes tend to be increasingly persistent as people age.”

# political views change over time
brits become more conservative as they age, but it's not associated with most significant life events: <https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379413000875> Ageing makes people more likely to vote Conservative. The question of whether future Conservative support is threatened by generational replacement can therefore be answered with some confidence in the negative. Newer generations are not less Conservative than older generations once ageing effects are controlled for using side information taken from the panel studies. There are nonetheless identifiable political generations. Individuals born in certain years appear more or less Conservative, ignoring trend effects, depending on the prevailing political conditions at the time that they entered the electorate. [....] Given the increasing longevity of the electorate and the increased proportion who are elderly, our findings indicate that over time we should expect to see an increasingly Conservative electorate. [....] The elderly are not Conservative because they are rich, but because they are elderly. [....] While we can rule out some social ageing effects (due to marriage, income changes and so forth), we do not know exactly why people become more supportive of the right as they age.

# trigger warnings
#####o
among those without experience of PTSD, trigger warnings significantly increase anxiety among those who believe that words can harm people: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791618301137> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.jbtep.2018.07.002> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636098824443658242/unknown.png Participants were recruited on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk[.] [....] A single-item screening question excluded individuals who had experienced a canonical stressor (e.g., rape, natural disaster) qualifying for Criterion A of the PTSD diagnosis in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Three hundred participants completed the study. Four participants were excluded from all analyses because they reported having received a diagnosis of PTSD despite denying exposure to canonical traumatic stressors. [....] A simple slopes analysis indicated that for participants who do not have a strong belief that words can cause harm (MWCHS – 1 SD), receiving a trigger warning does not significantly increase anxiety from baseline (B = -4.57, t(265) = -1.73, ns). However, if participants have a strong belief that words can harm (MWCHS + 1 SD), trigger warnings significantly increase anxiety from baseline (B = 5.90, t(265) = 2.20, p < .05).
among those who believe trigger warnings are protecting against anxiety, trigger warnings significantly increase negative affect : <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/are-trigger-warnings-actually-helpful/> <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311830060X> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.jesp.2018.08.006> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636102465594458122/unknown.png We recruited 120 individuals from across the United States through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), but an additional 28 additional participants signed up despite not finishing the survey. Of these 148 individuals, 4 were excluded on account of English being their second language and 64 participants dropped out of the survey after informed consent but prior to answering any questions, resulting in a final sample of 80 participants. [....] There was, however, a significant warning × beliefs interaction (F(2, 702) = 4.54, p = .01, partial η2 = 0.013) (See Fig. 5). Simple effects reveal that those who believed trigger warnings to be coddling (one standard deviation below the mean) experienced more negative affect in the control condition compared to both the Trigger Warning Only condition (Mdifference= 4.69, 95% CI [1.74 7.65], p = .002, d = 0.30) and the Trigger Warning with Content condition (Mdifference= 4.15, 95% CI [1.45, 6.85], p = .003, d = 0.28).
trigger warnings insignificantly decreased negative affect: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702619827018> <http://sci-hub.tw/10.1177/2167702619827018> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636103889879302155/unknown.png As Table 3 shows, in the rows labeled “Content,” we instead found the effects of trigger warnings were once again trivially small. In standardized terms, the effects for this subset were: rating of material: dUnbiased = 0.00, 95% CI = [–0.40, 0.40]; negative affect: dUnbiased = –0.26, 95% CI = [–0.57, 0.05]; intrusion tally: dUnbiased = –0.02, 95% CI = [–0.61, 0.57]; IES intrusions: dUnbiased = –0.10, 95% CI = [–0.54, 0.34]; comprehension: dUnbiased = –0.17, 95% CI = [–0.74, 0.39]; avoidance: dUnbiased = 0.04, 95% CI = [–0.68, 0.76]).

https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2014-mar-30-la-fi-hiltzik-20140330-story.html Nor was that a new phenomenon. Part of the mythology of the Great Depression is that charitable giving rose during those hard times, but the truth is exactly the opposite. Overall giving fell by more than a fifth from 1929 through 1933, adjusted for inflation, before starting to recover. Among the wealthy, it fell an inflation-adjusted 70% in 1931-35 — about the magnitude of the stock market drop that had devastated wealth in the capital-owning class.

https://hbr.org/2009/06/the-worst-question-to-ask-abou.html Well, the media, the watchdogs, and the sector itself have done an amazing job of training the public to think that the two things are the same, i.e., that if a charity has low overhead, it must be making a difference. Major studies on the relationship between organizational strength and impact find otherwise.

# private: procyclical
private charity stays around 2% of GDP: private charity is procyclical -- it declines during recessions and increases during expansions -- meaning that private charity increases recession depth: <https://slate.com/business/2014/03/private-charity-and-the-safety-net-why-philanthropy-cant-replace-government.html> <https://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/CharitableGiving_fact_sheet.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636700753716576296/unknown.png ```It is perhaps reassuring that there’s no evidence of increasing stinginess in times of need. Then again, neither is there evidence of increased largesse, which is problematic because need is countercyclical. Indeed, because needs increase dramatically as the economy contracts, our reliance on charity and the nonprofit sector contains some built-in structural challenges, at least relative to other countries that can more readily engage in direct governmental spending when additional needs must be met.```
during the Great Depression, private charity increased -- but not nearly as much as public spending increased, and not for as long: <https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Charity.html#lfHendersonCEE2-022_table_008> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/418850379518705675/636703555755180039/unknown.png

# public: countercyclical
public spending jumps from .1 to 2.2% of GDP: in contrast, automatic stabilizers are countercyclical -- they increase during recessions and decrease during expansions -- meaning that public spending decreases recession depth: <https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/32/the-voluntarism-fantasy/> During 2009, while private charity collapsed, automatic stabilizers expanded rapidly, from 0.1 percent of GDP to 2.2 percent of GDP—or a number roughly akin to all charitable giving in the United States. This was directly targeted at areas that suffered from the most unemployment, and helped those most in need—efforts that, as we’ve seen, private charity does only partially. As Goldman Sachs economists concluded, this shift made a crucial difference, and, alongside the government’s efforts to prevent the collapse of the banking sector and the Federal Reserve’s expansion of monetary policy, was a core reason the Great Recession didn’t become a second Great Depression.

# private: gilded era [unformatted]
there was never a time when the state was uninvolved in helping the needy: <https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/32/the-voluntarism-fantasy/> [A] significant amount of research has been done over the past several decades to overturn the myth of a stateless nineteenth century and to rediscover the lost role of the state in the pre-New Deal world. [....] As the political scientist Theda Skocpol has documented, there were also multiple examples of state-issued social insurance programs before the New Deal. In the wake of the Civil War, Congress established an elaborate system of pensions for veterans. At its height in 1910, this de facto disability and old-age pension system delivered benefits to more than 25 percent of all American men over 65, accounting for a quarter of the federal government’s expenditures. Between 1911 and 1920, 40 states passed laws establishing “mothers’ pensions” for single women with children. These programs provided payments for needy widowed mothers in order to allow them to provide for their children.

<http://abt.ucpress.edu/content/72/5/38> First, show the class a photograph of a cancer cell labeled "GFP." [...] Briefly mention the leaps in understanding of cancer cell growth and cell division that GFP has made possible. Introduce the students to [...] Osamu Shimomura, who [...] was hired to simply investigate why a dried jellyfish glowed green when crushed. The resulting manuscript describing GFP gives no hint to the future implications of this protein (Shimomura et al., 1957), a discovery for which he would eventually share the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008. Finally, [...] [m]ention the importance of sequencing in understanding the evolution of HIV. [...] [I]ntroduce them to a profile of John Trela, Alice Chien, and David Edgar, who discovered Taq polymerase during basic research investigations. This discovery has earned billions of dollars in royalties (Fore et al., 2006) yet was the unintentional result of a basic research investigation into life at high temperatures (Chien et al., 1976).
<https://www.aaas.org/news/report-basic-science-research-critical-us-well-being> "Basic research is often misunderstood, because it often seems to have no immediate payoff," the MIT report says. "Yet it was just such federally funded research into the fundamental working of cells, intensified beginning with the 'War on Cancer' in 1971, that led over time to a growing arsenal of sophisticated new anticancer therapies — 19 new drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the past two years." It adds, "Do we want similar progress on Alzheimer's, which already affects five million Americans, more than any single form of cancer? Then we should expand research in neurobiology, brain chemistry and the science of aging."

# all your heroes are socialists

Albert Einstein (physicist, socialist): "I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child." May 1949, "Why Socialism?" <https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/>
Mohandas Gandhi (activist, socialist): Socialism is a beautiful word and so far as I am aware in socialism all the members of society are equal — none low, non-high. In the individual body, the head is not high because it is the top of the body, nor are the soles of the feet low because they touch the earth. Even as members of the individual body are equal, so are the members of society. This is socialism." -- in Harijan weekly journal 13 July 1947 <https://books.google.com/books?id=2PhRAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA16&pg=PA16#v=onepage&f=false>
Martin Luther King (activist, socialist): "[W]hen we see that there must be a radical redistribution of economic and political power, then we see that for the last twelve years we have been in a reform movement…That after Selma and the Voting Rights Bill, we moved into a new era, which must be an era of revolution." -- speech to SCLC retreat in May 1967 <https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/history/>
George Orwell (author, libertarian socialist): "The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it. It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects." in "Why I Write", Gangrel, No. 4, Summer 1946 <http://srjcstaff.santarosa.edu/~mheydon/whywriteD.pdf>
Nelson Mandela (first black President of South Africa, Marxist socialist): "Today I am attracted by the idea of a classless society, an attraction which springs in part from Marxist reading and, in part, from my admiration of the structure and organisation of early African societies in this country. The land, then the main means of production, belonged to the tribe. There were no rich or poor and there was no exploitation. It is true, as I have already stated, that I have been influenced by Marxist thought. But this is also true of many of the leaders of the new independent states. Such widely different persons as Gandhi, Nehru, Nkrumah, and Nasser all acknowledge this fact. We all accept the need for some form of socialism to enable our people to catch up with the advanced countries of this world and to overcome their legacy of extreme poverty. But this does not mean we are Marxists." -- statement to the Supreme Court of South Africa, 20 April 1964 <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/23/nelsonmandela2>
Charlie Chaplin (director & actor, socialist): "Wells wanted to know how I became interested in socialism. It was not until I came to the United States and met Upton Sinclair, I told him. We were driving to his house in Pasadena for lunch and he asked me in his soft-spoken way if I believed in the profit system. It was a disarming question, but instinctively I felt it went to the very root of the matter, and from that moment I became interested and saw politics not as history but as an economic problem." -- My Autobiography, 1964 <https://books.google.com/books?id=31UyYJnDhJsC&lpg=PP1&dq=My%20Autobiography%20(Neversink)&pg=PT454#v=onepage&q&f=false>
Helen Keller (blind & deaf, pro-revolution Socialist Party member) : "The structure of a society built upon such wrong basic principles is bound to retard the development of all men, even the most successful ones, because it tends to divert man’s energies into useless channels and to degrade his character. [....] This unmoral state of society will continue as long as we live under a system of universal competition for the means of existence. [....] It must, therefore, be changed, it must be destroyed, and a better, saner, kinder social order established. Competition must give place to co-operation, and class antagonism to brotherhood." -- in "Blind Leaders", Outlook for the Blind 105, 27 September 1913 <https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/keller-helen/works/1910s/13_10_25.htm> <https://isreview.org/issue/96/politics-helen-keller>
Hayao Miyazaki (animator, Marxist socialist, union chairman): "I believe a company is common property of the people that work there. But that is a socialistic idea. Nowadays, American style capitalism has become mainstream. The stock holders have voices and change managers to get more profit in the current term. In addition to that, they downsize or restructure regular employees and enlarge temporary workers and part time workers. For them, temporary workers are just disposable. On the other hand, regular employees also are completely exhausted in hard work. Such a system is quite Animal Farm like." -- 2012 interview <http://archive.is/aTQ1>

# denial: noaa whistleblower admits climate change data fabricated

According to Dr. John Bates, the recently retired principal scientist at NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center, the Karl study was used “to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy.”
response: the "whistleblower", who's a retired scientist, themself disagrees: <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/feb/09/whistleblower-i-knew-people-would-misuse-this-they-did-to-attack-climate-science> <https://www.factcheck.org/2017/02/no-data-manipulation-at-noaa/> The issue here is not an issue of tampering with data, but rather really of timing of a release of a paper that had not properly disclosed everything it was.

The database was built from Keane and Martinez [2007], which lists all geosciences faculty at reporting academic institutions, along with researchers at state geologic surveys associated with local universities, and researchers at U.S. federal research facilities[.] [....] 1. When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant? 2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures? [....] [T]he most common areas of expertise reported were geochemistry (15.5%), geophysics (12%), and oceanography (10.5%). General geology, hydrology/hydrogeology, and paleontology each accounted for 5–7% of the total respondents. Approximately 5% of the respondents were climate scientists, and 8.5% of the respondents indicated that more than 50% of their peer-reviewed publications in the past 5 years have been on the subject of climate change. [....] In our survey, the most specialized and knowledgeable respondents (with regard to climate change) are those who listed climate science as their area of expertise and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peerreviewed papers on the subject of climate change (79 individuals in total). Of these specialists, 96.2% (76 of 79) answered “risen” to question 1 and 97.4% (75 of 77) answered yes to question 2.

Using data from a climate reanalysis (see Methods), we found that in 2000, ∼13.2% of the planet’s land area, where ~30.6% of the world’s human population resides, was exposed to 20 or more days when temperature and humidity surpassed the threshold beyond which such conditions become deadly (Fig. 2, extended results in Supplementary Fig. 4). [....] We found that by 2100, even under the most aggressive mitigation scenario (that is, RCP 2.6), ~26.9% (±8.7% s.d.) of the world’s land area will be exposed to temperature and humidity conditions exceeding the deadly threshold by more than 20 days per year, exposing ~47.6% (±9.6% s.d.) of the world’s human population to deadly climates (using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways projections of future human population29 relevant to each of the CMIP5 RCPs, see Methods). Scenarios with higher emissions will affect an even greater percentage of the global land area and human population. By 2100, ~34.1% (±7.6% s.d.) and ∼47.1% (±8.9% s.d.) of the global land area will be exposed to temperature and humidity conditions that exceed the deadly threshold for more than 20 days per year under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively; this will expose ~53.7% (±8.7% s.d.) and ~73.9% (±6.6% s.d.) of the world’s human population to deadly climates by the end of the century (Fig. 2, extended results in Supplementary Fig. 4).

They conclude that in terms of cumulative energy payback, or the time to produce the amount of energy required of production and installation, a wind turbine with a working life of 20 years will offer a net benefit within five to eight months of being brought online.

As of 2017, the cost (before tax credits that would further drop the costs) of wind power was $30-60 per megawatt-hour (a measure of energy), and large-scale solar cost $43-53/MWh. For comparison: energy from the most efficient type of natural gas plants cost $42-78/MWh; coal power cost at least $60/MWh.

# scientific realism
descriptive realism from No Miracles Argument: current scientific theories perform better than chance, ergo scientific theories are true: <https://philpapers.org/archive/PARTDA-10.pdf> Descriptive realism would be true if T [a strong, current scientific theory] is as descriptive realism holds it to be, i.e., if T is true, and false if T is not as descriptive realism holds it to be, i.e., if T is false. T is directly rendered true or false by the world. Consequently, descriptive realism is indirectly rendered true or false by the world.
normative realism from NMA: current scientific theories perform better than chance, ergo scientific theories are true: <https://philpapers.org/archive/PARTDA-10.pdf> By contrast, normative realism, because it is a normative thesis, is not capable of being true or false. Even if T [a strong, current scientific theory] happens to be true, it is an open question whether it is warranted or not, as will become clear in the next section.
descriptive pessimism: past scientific theories were false, ergo present scientific theories are false: <https://philpapers.org/archive/PARTDA-10.pdf> The descriptive PI holds that just as T1 [a past scientific theory] was false, so T2 [a current scientific theory] is false, where the former is a past theory and the latter is a present theory. This version of the PI can be inferred from Putnam’s formulation of the PI that “Just as no term used in the science of more than fifty (or whatever) years ago referred, so it will turn out that no term used now (except maybe observational terms, if there are such) refers” (1978: 25). The descriptive PI can also be inferred from Stathis Psillos’s formulation of the PI that “if most past successful scientific theories turned out to be false, then, by induction on scientific theories, one must not just remain agnostic, but rather claim that current successful scientific theories are likely to be false” (1995: 16). Keep in mind that the descriptive PI asserts that T2 is false.
descriptive pessimism: past scientific theories were unwarranted, ergo present scientific theories are unwarranted: <https://philpapers.org/archive/PARTDA-10.pdf> In contrast, the normative PI holds that just as T1 [a past scientific theory] was unwarranted, so T2 [a current scientific theory] is unwarranted. The normative PI is neutral about the truth-value of T2. It says that T2 might be true, and that even though T2 is true, we cannot justifiably believe that it is true. No one has directly formulated the PI in this manner in the literature. It, however, can be inferred from James Ladyman’s formulation that “reflection on the abandonment of theories in the history of science motivates the expectation that our best current scientific theories will themselves be abandoned, and hence that we ought not to assent to them” (Ladyman, 2014). To say that we ought not to assent to present theories is to say that T2 is unwarranted.

2015: Soylent recalled 80 bottles of Soylent drink 2.0 over reports of mold in the drinks: <https://discourse.soylent.com/t/blog-post-shipping-delay-root-cause-analysis/23843>
Although Soylent contains levels of lead and cadmium far below the national safety levels set by the FDA, it does contain 12 to 25 times the level of lead and 4 times the level of cadmium allowable in a product without additional labeling as specified by Proposition 65.[35][36] A lawyer who has worked on settlements of Proposition 65 suits described the case as "alarmist", as the levels are well below FDA limits of what is allowed in food products.[37] However, as Soylent is marketed as a complete meal replacement, many customers consume the drinks three times a day, equating to 36 to 75 times the lead and 12 times the level of cadmium without the Prop 65 label.[38] As You Sow believes these levels may be harmful.[35] Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones, and even at low levels is linked to nerve damage, lower IQ, and reproductive problems including decreased sperm count. Cadmium is also a toxic heavy metal and has been linked to kidney, liver, and bone damage.[38]
